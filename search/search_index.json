Before reading this document, it will be helpful to have some familiarity with the basic concepts explained in knora-base. Knora comes with two example projects, called incunabula and images-demo . Here we will consider the incunabula example, which is a reduced version of a real research project on early printed books. It is designed to store an image of each page of each book, as well as RDF data about books, pages, their contents, and relationships between them. At the moment, only the RDF data is provided in the example project, not the images. The incunabula ontology is in the file incunabula-onto.ttl , and its data is in the file incunabula-demo-data.ttl . Both these files are in a standard RDF file format called Turtle . The Knora distribution includes sample scripts (in the webapi/scripts directory) for importing these files directly into different triplestores. If you are starting a new project from scratch, you can adapt these scripts to import your ontology (and any existing RDF data) into your triplestore for use with Knora. The syntax of Turtle is fairly simple: it is basically a sequence of triples. We will consider some details of Turtle syntax as we go along. The Incunabula Ontology Here we will just focus on some of the main aspects of the ontology. An ontology file typically begins by defining prefixes for the IRIs of other ontologies that will be referred to. First there are some prefixes for ontologies that are very commonly used in RDF: @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> . @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> . @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> . @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> . @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> . @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> . The rdf , rdfs , and owl ontologies contain basic properties that are used to define ontology entities. The xsd ontology contains definitions of literal data types such as string and integer . (For more information about these ontologies, see the references in knora-base.) The foaf ontology contains classes and properties for representing people. The dcterms ontology represents Dublin Core metadata. Then we define prefixes for Knora ontologies: @prefix knora-base: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> . @prefix salsah-gui: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/salsah-gui#> . The knora-base ontology contains Knora's core abstractions, and is described in knora-base. The salsah-gui ontology includes properties that Knora projects must use to enable SALSAH, Knora's generic virtual research environment. For convenience, we can use the empty prefix to refer to the incunabula ontology itself: @prefix : <http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula#> . However, outside the ontology file, it would make more sense to define an incunabula prefix to refer to the incunabula ontology. Properties All the content produced by a Knora project must be stored in Knora resources (see incunabula-resource-classes). Resources have properties that point to different parts of their contents; for example, the incunabula project contains books, which have properties like title . Every property that poitns to a Knora value must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue , and every property that points to another Knora resource must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . Here is the definition of the incunabula:title property: :title rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:hasValue, dcterms:title ; rdfs:label \"Titel\"@de , \"Titre\"@fr , \"Titolo\"@it , \"Title\"@en ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue ; salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:SimpleText ; salsah-gui:guiAttribute \"size=80\" , \"maxlength=255\" . The definition of incunabula:title consists of a list of triples, all of which have :title as their subject. To avoid repeating :title for each triple, Turtle syntax allows us to use a semicolon ( ; ) to separate triples that have the same subject. Moreover, some triples also have the same predicate; a comma ( , ) is used to avoid repeating the predicate. The definition of :title says: rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty : It is an owl:ObjectProperty . There are two kinds of OWL properties: object properties and datatype properties. Object properties point to objects, which have IRIs and can have their own properties. Datatype properties point to literal values, such as strings and integers. rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:hasValue, dcterms:title : It is a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue and dcterms:title . Since the objects of this property will be Knora values, it must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue . To facilitate searches, we have also chosen to make it a subproperty of dcterms:title . In the Knora API v2, if you do a search for resources that have a certain dcterms:title , and there is a resource with a matching incunabula:title , the search results could include that resource. rdfs:label \"Titel\"@de , etc.: It has the specified labels in various languages. These are needed, for example, by user interfaces, to prompt the user to enter a value. knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book : The subject of the property must be an incunabula:book . knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue : The object of this property must be a knora-base:TextValue (which is a subclass of knora-base:Value ). salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:SimpleText : When SALSAH asks a user to enter a value for this property, it should use a simple text field. salsah-gui:guiAttribute \"size=80\" , \"maxlength=255\" : The SALSAH text field for entering a value for this property should be 80 characters wide, and should accept at most 255 characters. The incunabula ontology contains several other property definitions that are basically similar. Note that different subclasses of Value are used. For example, incunabula:pubdate , which represents the publication date of a book, points to a knora-base:DateValue . The DateValue class stores a date range, with a specified degree of precision and a preferred calendar system for display. A property can point to a Knora resource instead of to a Knora value. For example, in the incunabula ontology, there are resources representing pages and books, and each page is part of some book. This relationship is expressed using the property incunabula:partOf : :partOf rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:isPartOf ; rdfs:label \"ist ein Teil von\"@de , \"est un part de\"@fr , \"e una parte di\"@it , \"is a part of\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"\"\"Diese Property bezeichnet eine Verbindung zu einer anderen Resource, in dem ausgesagt wird, dass die vorliegende Resource ein integraler Teil der anderen Resource ist. Zum Beispiel ist eine Buchseite ein integraler Bestandteil genau eines Buches.\"\"\"@de ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :page ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint :book ; salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:Searchbox . The key things to notice here are: rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:isPartOf : The Knora base ontology provides a generic isPartOf property to express part-whole relationships. Like many properties defined in knora-base , a project cannot use knora-base:isPartOf directly, but must make a subproperty such as incunabula:partOf . It is important to note that knora-base:isPartOf is a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . Any property that points to a knora-base:Resource must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . In Knora terminology, such a property is called a link property . knora-base:objectClassConstraint :book : The object of this property must be a member of the class incunabula:book , which, as we will see below, is a subclass of knora-base:Resource . salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:Searchbox : When SALSAH prompts a user to select the book that a page is part of, it should provide a search box enabling the user to find the desired book. Because incunabula:partOf is a link property, it must always accompanied by a link value property , which enables Knora to store metadata about each link that is created with the link property. This metadata includes the date and time when the link was created, its owner, the permissions it grants, and whether it has been deleted. Storing this metadata allows Knora to authorise users to see or modify the link, as well as to query a previous state of a repository in which a deleted link had not yet been deleted. (The ability to query previous states of a repository is planned for Knora API version 2.) The name of a link property and its link value property must be related by the following naming convention: to determine the name of the link value property, add the word Value to the name of the link property. Hence, the incunabula ontology defines the property partOfValue : :partOfValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:isPartOfValue ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :page ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:LinkValue . As a link value property, incunabula:partOfValue must point to a knora-base:LinkValue . The LinkValue class is an RDF reification of a triple (in this case, the triple that links a page to a book). For more details about this, see knora-base-linkvalue. Note that the property incunabula:hasAuthor points to a knora-base:TextValue , because the incunabula project represents authors simply by their names. A more complex project could represent each author as a resource, in which case incunabula:hasAuthor would need to be a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . Resource Classes The two main resource classes in the incunabula ontology are book and page . Here is incunabula:book : :book rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :title ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasAuthor ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"2\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :publisher ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"3\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :publoc ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"4\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :pubdate ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"5\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :location ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"6\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :url ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"7\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :description ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"2\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :physical_desc ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"9\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :note ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"10\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :citation ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"5\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :book_comment ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"12\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; knora-base:resourceIcon \"book.gif\" ; rdfs:label \"Buch\"@de , \"Livre\"@fr , \"Libro\"@it , \"Book\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"\"\"Diese Resource-Klasse beschreibt ein Buch\"\"\"@de . Like every Knora resource class, incunabula:book is a subclass of knora-base:Resource . It is also a subclass of a number of other classes of type owl:Restriction , which are defined in square brackets, using Turtle's syntax for anonymous blank nodes. Each owl:Restriction specifies a cardinality for a property that is allowed in resources of type incunabula:book . A cardinality is indeed a kind of restriction: it means that a resource of this type may have, or must have, a certain number of instances of the specified property. For example, incunabula:book has cardinalities saying that a book must have at least one title and at most one publication date. In the Knora API version 1, the word 'occurrence' is used instead of 'cardinality'. The OWL cardinalities supported by Knora are described in OWL Cardinalities . Note that incunabula:book specifies a cardinality of owl:minCardinality 0 on the property incunabula:hasAuthor . At first glance, this might seem as if it serves no purpose, since it says that the property is optional and can have any number of instances. You may be wondering whether this cardinality could simply be omitted from the definition of incunabula:book . However, Knora requires every property of a resource to have some cardinality in the resource's class. This is because Knora uses the cardinalities to determine which properties are possible for instances of the class, and the Knora API relies on this information. If there was no cardinality for incunabula:hasAuthor , Knora would not allow a book to have an author. Each owl:Restriction specifying a cardinality can include the predicate salsah-gui:guiOrder , which tells the SALSAH GUI the order the properties should be displayed in. Here is the definition of incunabula:page : :page rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:StillImageRepresentation , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :pagenum ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :partOfValue ; owl:cardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"2\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :partOf ; owl:cardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"2\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :seqnum ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"3\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :description ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"2\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :citation ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"5\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :page_comment ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"6\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :origname ; owl:cardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"7\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasLeftSidebandValue ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"10\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasLeftSideband ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"10\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasRightSidebandValue ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"11\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasRightSideband ; owl:maxCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"11\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :transcription ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ; salsah-gui:guiOrder \"12\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; knora-base:resourceIcon \"page.gif\" ; rdfs:label \"Seite\"@de , \"Page\"@fr , \"Page\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"\"\"Eine Seite ist ein Teil eines Buchs\"\"\"@de , \"\"\"Une page est une partie d'un livre\"\"\"@fr , \"\"\"A page is a part of a book\"\"\"@en . The incunabula:page class is a subclass of knora-base:StillImageRepresentation , which is a subclass of knora-base:Representation , which is a subclass of knora-base:Resource . The class knora-base:Representation is used for resources that contain metadata about files stored by Knora. Each It has different subclasses that can hold different types of files, including still images, audio, and video files. A given Representation can store metadata about several different files, as long as they are of the same type and are semantically equivalent, e.g. are different versions of the same image with different colorspaces, so that coordinates in one file will work in the other files. In Knora, a subclass inherits the cardinalities defined in its superclasses. Let's look at the class hierarchy of incunabula:page , starting with knora-base:Representation : :Representation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; rdfs:comment \"A resource that can store one or more FileValues\"@en . This says that a Representation must have at least one instance of the property hasFileValue , which is defined like this: :hasFileValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasValue ; :subjectClassConstraint :Representation ; :objectClassConstraint :FileValue . The subject of hasFileValue must be a Representation , and its object must be a FileValue . There are different subclasses of FileValue for different kinds of files, but we'll skip the details here. This is the definition of knora-base:StillImageRepresentation : :StillImageRepresentation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Representation , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasStillImageFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; rdfs:comment \"A resource that can contain two-dimensional still image files\"@en . It must have at least one instance of the property hasStillImageFileValue , which is defined as follows: :hasStillImageFileValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasFileValue ; :subjectClassConstraint :StillImageRepresentation ; :objectClassConstraint :StillImageFileValue . Because hasStillImageFileValue is a subproperty of hasFileValue , the cardinality on hasStillImageFileValue , defined in the subclass StillImageRepresentation , overrides the cardinality on hasFileValue , defined in the superclass Representation . In other words, the more general cardinality in the superclass is replaced by a more specific cardinality in the base class. Since incunabula:page is a subclass of StillImageRepresentation , it inherits the cardinality on hasStillImageFileValue . As a result, a page must have at least one image file attached to it. Here's another example of cardinality inheritance. The class knora-base:Resource has a cardinality for knora-base:seqnum . The idea is that resources of any type could be arranged in some sort of sequence. As we saw above, incunabula:page is a subclass of knora-base:Resource . But incunabula:page has its own cardinality for incunabula:seqnum , which is a subproperty of knora-base:seqnum . Once again, the subclass's cardinality on the subproperty replaces the superclass's cardinality on the superproperty: a page is allowed to have an incunabula:seqnum , but it is not allowed to have a knora-base:seqnum .","title":"An Example Project"},{"location":"01-introduction/example-project/#an-example-project","text":"This section introduces some of the basic concepts involved in creating ontologies for Knora projects, by means of a relatively simple example project. Before reading this document, it will be helpful to have some familiarity with the basic concepts explained in knora-base. Knora comes with two example projects, called incunabula and images-demo . Here we will consider the incunabula example, which is a reduced version of a real research project on early printed books. It is designed to store an image of each page of each book, as well as RDF data about books, pages, their contents, and relationships between them. At the moment, only the RDF data is provided in the example project, not the images. The incunabula ontology is in the file incunabula-onto.ttl , and its data is in the file incunabula-demo-data.ttl . Both these files are in a standard RDF file format called Turtle . The Knora distribution includes sample scripts (in the webapi/scripts directory) for importing these files directly into different triplestores. If you are starting a new project from scratch, you can adapt these scripts to import your ontology (and any existing RDF data) into your triplestore for use with Knora. The syntax of Turtle is fairly simple: it is basically a sequence of triples. We will consider some details of Turtle syntax as we go along.","title":"An Example Project"},{"location":"01-introduction/example-project/#the-incunabula-ontology","text":"Here we will just focus on some of the main aspects of the ontology. An ontology file typically begins by defining prefixes for the IRIs of other ontologies that will be referred to. First there are some prefixes for ontologies that are very commonly used in RDF: @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> . @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> . @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> . @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> . @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> . @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> . The rdf , rdfs , and owl ontologies contain basic properties that are used to define ontology entities. The xsd ontology contains definitions of literal data types such as string and integer . (For more information about these ontologies, see the references in knora-base.) The foaf ontology contains classes and properties for representing people. The dcterms ontology represents Dublin Core metadata. Then we define prefixes for Knora ontologies: @prefix knora-base: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> . @prefix salsah-gui: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/salsah-gui#> . The knora-base ontology contains Knora's core abstractions, and is described in knora-base. The salsah-gui ontology includes properties that Knora projects must use to enable SALSAH, Knora's generic virtual research environment. For convenience, we can use the empty prefix to refer to the incunabula ontology itself: @prefix : <http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula#> . However, outside the ontology file, it would make more sense to define an incunabula prefix to refer to the incunabula ontology.","title":"The Incunabula Ontology"},{"location":"01-introduction/example-project/#properties","text":"All the content produced by a Knora project must be stored in Knora resources (see incunabula-resource-classes). Resources have properties that point to different parts of their contents; for example, the incunabula project contains books, which have properties like title . Every property that poitns to a Knora value must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue , and every property that points to another Knora resource must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . Here is the definition of the incunabula:title property: :title rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:hasValue, dcterms:title ; rdfs:label \"Titel\"@de , \"Titre\"@fr , \"Titolo\"@it , \"Title\"@en ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue ; salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:SimpleText ; salsah-gui:guiAttribute \"size=80\" , \"maxlength=255\" . The definition of incunabula:title consists of a list of triples, all of which have :title as their subject. To avoid repeating :title for each triple, Turtle syntax allows us to use a semicolon ( ; ) to separate triples that have the same subject. Moreover, some triples also have the same predicate; a comma ( , ) is used to avoid repeating the predicate. The definition of :title says: rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty : It is an owl:ObjectProperty . There are two kinds of OWL properties: object properties and datatype properties. Object properties point to objects, which have IRIs and can have their own properties. Datatype properties point to literal values, such as strings and integers. rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:hasValue, dcterms:title : It is a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue and dcterms:title . Since the objects of this property will be Knora values, it must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue . To facilitate searches, we have also chosen to make it a subproperty of dcterms:title . In the Knora API v2, if you do a search for resources that have a certain dcterms:title , and there is a resource with a matching incunabula:title , the search results could include that resource. rdfs:label \"Titel\"@de , etc.: It has the specified labels in various languages. These are needed, for example, by user interfaces, to prompt the user to enter a value. knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book : The subject of the property must be an incunabula:book . knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue : The object of this property must be a knora-base:TextValue (which is a subclass of knora-base:Value ). salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:SimpleText : When SALSAH asks a user to enter a value for this property, it should use a simple text field. salsah-gui:guiAttribute \"size=80\" , \"maxlength=255\" : The SALSAH text field for entering a value for this property should be 80 characters wide, and should accept at most 255 characters. The incunabula ontology contains several other property definitions that are basically similar. Note that different subclasses of Value are used. For example, incunabula:pubdate , which represents the publication date of a book, points to a knora-base:DateValue . The DateValue class stores a date range, with a specified degree of precision and a preferred calendar system for display. A property can point to a Knora resource instead of to a Knora value. For example, in the incunabula ontology, there are resources representing pages and books, and each page is part of some book. This relationship is expressed using the property incunabula:partOf : :partOf rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:isPartOf ; rdfs:label \"ist ein Teil von\"@de , \"est un part de\"@fr , \"e una parte di\"@it , \"is a part of\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"\"\"Diese Property bezeichnet eine Verbindung zu einer anderen Resource, in dem ausgesagt wird, dass die vorliegende Resource ein integraler Teil der anderen Resource ist. Zum Beispiel ist eine Buchseite ein integraler Bestandteil genau eines Buches.\"\"\"@de ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :page ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint :book ; salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:Searchbox . The key things to notice here are: rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:isPartOf : The Knora base ontology provides a generic isPartOf property to express part-whole relationships. Like many properties defined in knora-base , a project cannot use knora-base:isPartOf directly, but must make a subproperty such as incunabula:partOf . It is important to note that knora-base:isPartOf is a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . Any property that points to a knora-base:Resource must be a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo . In Knora terminology, such a property is called a link property . knora-base:objectClassConstraint :book : The object of this property must be a member of the class incunabula:book , which, as we will see below, is a subclass of knora-base:Resource . salsah-gui:guiElement salsah-gui:Searchbox : When SALSAH prompts a user to select the book that a page is part of, it should provide a search box enabling the user to find the desired book. Because incunabula:partOf is a link property, it must always accompanied by a link value property , which enables Knora to store metadata about each link that is created with the link property. This metadata includes the date and time when the link was created, its owner, the permissions it grants, and whether it has been deleted. Storing this metadata allows Knora to authorise users to see or modify the link, as well as to query a previous state of a repository in which a deleted link had not yet been deleted. (The ability to query previous states of a repository is planned for Knora API version 2.) The name of a link property and its link value property must be related by the following naming convention: to determine the name of the link value property, add the word Value to the name of the link property. Hence, the incunabula ontology defines the property partOfValue : :partOfValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf knora-base:isPartOfValue ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :page ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:LinkValue . As a link value property, incunabula:partOfValue must point to a knora-base:LinkValue . The LinkValue class is an RDF reification of a triple (in this case, the triple that links a page to a book). For more details about this, see knora-base-linkvalue. Note that the property incunabula:hasAuthor points to a knora-base:TextValue , because the incunabula project represents authors simply by their names. A more complex project could represent each author as a resource, in which case incunabula:hasAuthor would need to be a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo .","title":"Properties"},{"location":"01-introduction/example-project/#resource-classes","text":"The two main resource classes in the incunabula ontology are book and page .

Like every Knora resource class, incunabula:book is a subclass of knora-base:Resource . It is also a subclass of a number of other classes of type owl:Restriction , which are defined in square brackets, using Turtle's syntax for anonymous blank nodes. Each owl:Restriction specifies a cardinality for a property that is allowed in resources of type incunabula:book . A cardinality is indeed a kind of restriction: it means that a resource of this type may have, or must have, a certain number of instances of the specified property. For example, incunabula:book has cardinalities saying that a book must have at least one title and at most one publication date. In the Knora API version 1, the word 'occurrence' is used instead of 'cardinality'. The OWL cardinalities supported by Knora are described in OWL Cardinalities . Note that incunabula:book specifies a cardinality of owl:minCardinality 0 on the property incunabula:hasAuthor . At first glance, this might seem as if it serves no purpose, since it says that the property is optional and can have any number of instances. You may be wondering whether this cardinality could simply be omitted from the definition of incunabula:book . However, Knora requires every property of a resource to have some cardinality in the resource's class. This is because Knora uses the cardinalities to determine which properties are possible for instances of the class, and the Knora API relies on this information. If there was no cardinality for incunabula:hasAuthor , Knora would not allow a book to have an author. Each owl:Restriction specifying a cardinality can include the predicate salsah-gui:guiOrder , which tells the SALSAH GUI the order the properties should be displayed in.

The class knora-base:Representation is used for resources that contain metadata about files stored by Knora.

The subject of hasFileValue must be a Representation , and its object must be a FileValue . There are different subclasses of FileValue for different kinds of files, but we'll skip the details here. This is the definition of knora-base:StillImageRepresentation : :StillImageRepresentation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Representation , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasStillImageFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; rdfs:comment \"A resource that can contain two-dimensional still image files\"@en .

Knora's Standoff/RDF markup stores content as a simple Unicode string, and represents markup separately as RDF data. This approach has some advantages over commonly used markup systems such as XML: First, XML and other hierarchical markup systems assume that a document is a hierarchy, and have difficulty representing non-hierarchical structures or multiple overlapping hierarchies. Standoff markup can easily represent these structures. Second, markup languages are typically designed to be used in text files. But there is no standard system for searching and linking together many different text files containing markup. It is possible to do this in a non-standard way by using an XML database such as eXist , but this still does not allow for queries that include text as well as non-textual data not stored in XML. By storing markup as RDF, Knora can search for markup structures in the same way that it searches for any RDF data structure. This makes it possible to do searches that combine text-related criteria with other sorts of criteria. For example, if persons and events are represented as Knora resources, and texts are represented in Standoff/RDF, a text can contain tags representing links to persons or events. You could then search for a text that mentions a person who lived in the same city as another person who is the author of a text that mentions an event that occurred during a certain time period. In Knora's Standoff/RDF, a tag is an RDF entity that is linked to a text value . Each tag points to a substring of the text, and has semantic properties of its own. You can define your own tag classes in your ontology by making subclasses of knora-base:StandoffTag , and attach your own properties to them. You can then search for those properties using Knora's search language, Gravsearch . The built-in knora-base and standoff ontologies provide some basic tags that can be reused or extended. These include tags that represent Knora data types. For example, knora-base:StandoffDateTag represents a date in exactly the same way as a Knora date value , i.e. as a calendar-independent astronomical date. You can use this tag as-is, or extend it by making a subclass, to represent dates in texts. Gravsearch includes built-in functionality for searching for these data type tags. For example, you can search for text containing a date that falls within a certain date range . Knora's APIs support automatic conversion between XML and Standoff/RDF. To make this work, Standoff/RDF stores the order of tags and their hierarchical relationships. You must define an XML-to-Standoff Mapping for your standoff tag classes and properties. Then you can import an XML document into Knora, which will store it as Standoff/RDF. The text and markup can then be searched using Gravsearch. When you retrieve the document, Knora converts it back to the original XML. To represent overlapping or non-hierarchical markup in exported and imported XML, Knora supports CLIX tags.

Knora (Knowledge Organization, Representation, and Annotation) is a a content management system for the long-term preservation and reuse of humanities data. It is designed to accommodate data with a complex internal structure, including data that could be stored in relational databases. Knora aims to solve key problems in the long-term preservation and reuse of humanities data: First, traditional archives preserve data, but do not facilitate reuse. Typically, only metadata can be searched, not the data itself. You have to first identify an information package that might be of interest, then download it, and only then can you find out what's really in it. This is time-consuming, and makes it impractical to reuse data from many different sources. Knora solves this problem by keeping the data alive. You can query all the data in a Knora repository, not just the metadata. You can import thousands of databases into Knora, and run queries that search through all of them at once. Another problem is that researchers use a multitude of different data formats, many of which are proprietary and quickly become obsolete. It is not practical to maintain all the programs that were used to create and read old data files, or even all the operating systems that these programs ran on. Instead of preserving all these data formats, Knora supports the conversion of all sorts of data to a small number of formats that are suitable for long-term preservation, and that maintain the data's meaning and structure: Non-binary data is stored as RDF , in a dedicated database called a triplestore. RDF is an open, vendor-independent standard that can express any data structure. Binary media files (images, audio, and video) are converted to a few specialised archival file formats and stored by Sipi , with metadata stored in the triplestore. Knora then makes this data available for reuse via its generic, standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs). A virtual research environment (VRE) can then use these APIs to search, link together, and add to data from different research projects in a unified way. Humanities-Focused Data Storage Each project creates its own data model (or ontology ), describing the types of items it wishes to store, using basic data types defined in Knora's base ontology . This gives projects the freedom to describe their data in a way that makes sense to them, while allowing Knora to support searching and linking across projects. Knora has built-in support for data structures that are commonly needed in humanities data, and that present unique challenges for any type of database storage. Calendar-Independent Dates In the humanities, a date could be based on any sort of calendar (e.g. Gregorian, Julian, Islamic, or Hebrew). Knora stores dates using a calendar-independent, astronomical representation, and converts between calendars as needed. This makes it possible to search for a date in one calendar, and get search results in other calendars. Flexible, Searchable Text Markup Commonly used text markup systems, such as TEI/XML , have to represent a text as a hierarchy, and therefore have trouble supporting overlapping markup. Knora supports Standoff/RDF markup : the markup is stored as RDF data, separately from the text, allowing for overlapping markup. Knora's RDF-based standoff is designed to support the needs of complex digital critical editions. Knora can import any XML document (including TEI/XML) for storage as standoff/RDF, and can regenerate the original XML document at any time. Powerful Searches Knora's API provides a search language, Gravsearch , that is designed to meet the needs of humanities researchers. Gravsearch supports Knora's humanites-focused data structures, including calendar-independent dates and standoff markup, as well as fast full-text searches. This allows searches to combine text-related criteria with any other criteria. For example, you could search for a text that contains a certain word and also mentions a person who lived in the same city as another person who is the author of a text that mentions an event that occurred during a certain time period. Access Control The RDF standards do not include any concept of permissions. Knora's permission system allows project administrators and users to determine who can see or modify each item of data. Knora filters search results according to each user's permissions. Data History RDF does not have a concept of data history. Knora maintains all previous versions of each item of data. Ordinary searches return only the latest version, but you can obtain and cite an item as it was at any point in the past. Data Consistency RDF triplestores do not implement a standardised way of ensuring the consistency of data in a repository. Knora ensures that all data is consistent, conforms the project-specific data models, and meets Knora's minimum requirements for interoperability and reusability of data. Linked Open Data Knora supports publishing data online as as Linked Open Data , using open standards to allow interoperability between different repositories on the web. Build Your Own Application Knora can be used with a general-purpose, browser-based VRE called SALSAH . Using the Knora API and Knora-ui , a set of reusable user-interface components, you can also create your own VRE or project-specific web site.","title":"What is Knora?"},{"location":"01-introduction/what-is-knora/#what-is-knora","text":"Knora (Knowledge Organization, Representation, and Annotation) is a a content management system for the long-term preservation and reuse of humanities data. It is designed to accommodate data with a complex internal structure, including data that could be stored in relational databases. Knora aims to solve key problems in the long-term preservation and reuse of humanities data: First, traditional archives preserve data, but do not facilitate reuse. Typically, only metadata can be searched, not the data itself. You have to first identify an information package that might be of interest, then download it, and only then can you find out what's really in it. This is time-consuming, and makes it impractical to reuse data from many different sources. Knora solves this problem by keeping the data alive. You can query all the data in a Knora repository, not just the metadata. You can import thousands of databases into Knora, and run queries that search through all of them at once. Another problem is that researchers use a multitude of different data formats, many of which are proprietary and quickly become obsolete. It is not practical to maintain all the programs that were used to create and read old data files, or even all the operating systems that these programs ran on. Instead of preserving all these data formats, Knora supports the conversion of all sorts of data to a small number of formats that are suitable for long-term preservation, and that maintain the data's meaning and structure: Non-binary data is stored as RDF , in a dedicated database called a triplestore. RDF is an open, vendor-independent standard that can express any data structure. Binary media files (images, audio, and video) are converted to a few specialised archival file formats and stored by Sipi , with metadata stored in the triplestore. Knora then makes this data available for reuse via its generic, standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs). A virtual research environment (VRE) can then use these APIs to search, link together, and add to data from different research projects in a unified way.","title":"What Is Knora?"},{"location":"01-introduction/what-is-knora/#humanities-focused-data-storage","text":"Each project creates its own data model (or ontology ), describing the types of items it wishes to store, using basic data types defined in Knora's base ontology .

Each project that uses Knora must describe its data model by creating ontologies that extend this ontology. The Knora base ontology is identified by the IRI http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base . In the Knora documentation in general, it is identified by the prefix knora-base , but for brevity, in this document, we use kb or omit the prefix entirely. The Knora Data Model The Knora data model is based on the observation that, in the humanities, a value or literal is often itself structured and can be highly complex. Moreover, a value may have its own metadata, such as its creation date, information about permissions, and so on. Therefore, the Knora base ontology describes structured value types that can store this type of metadata. In the diagram below, a book ( ex:book2 ) has a title (identified by the predicate ex:title ) and a publication date ( ex:pubdate ), each of which has some metadata. Projects In Knora, each item of data belongs to some particular project. Each project using Knora must define a kb:knoraProject , which has these properties (cardinalities are indicated in parentheses after each property name): projectShortname (1) : A short name that can be used to identify the project in configuration files and the like. projectLongname (1) : The full name of the project. projectShortcode (1) : A hexadecimal code that uniquely identifies the project. These codes are assigned to projects by the DaSCH . projectDescription (1-n) : A description of the project. belongsToInstitution (0-1) : The kb:Institution that the project belongs to. Ontologies and resources are associated with a project by means of the kb:attachedToProject property, as described in Ontologies and Properties of Resource ). Users are associated with a project by means of the kb:isInProject property, as described in Users and Groups . Ontologies Each user-created ontology must be defined as an owl:Ontology with the properties rdfs:label and kb:attachedToProject . Resources All the content produced by a project (e.g. digitised primary source materials or research data) must be stored in objects that belong to subclasses of kb:Resource , so that Knora can query and update that content. Each project using the Knora base ontology must define its own OWL classes, derived from kb:Resource , to represent the types of data it deals with. A subclass of kb:Resource may additionally be a subclass of any other class, e.g. an industry-standard class such as foaf:Person ; this can facilitate searches across projects. Resources have properties that point to different parts of the content they contain. For example, a resource representing a book could have a property called hasAuthor , pointing to the author of the book. There are two possible kinds of content in a Knora resource: Knora values (see Values ) or links to other resources (see Links Between Resources ). Properties that point to Knora values must be subproperties of kb:hasValue , and properties that point to other resources must be subproperties of kb:hasLinkTo . Either of these two types of properties may also be a subproperty of any other property, e.g. an industry-standard property such as foaf:name ; this can facilitate searches across projects. Each property definition must specify the types that its subjects and objects must belong to (see Constraints on the Types of Property Subjects and Objects for details). Each user-created resource class definition must use OWL cardinality restrictions to specify the properties that resources of that class can have (see OWL Cardinalities for details). Resources are not versioned; only their values are versioned (see Values ). Every resource is required to have an rdfs:label . The object of this property is an xsd:string , rather than a Knora value; hence it is not versioned. A user who has modify permission on a resource (see Authorisation ) can change its label. A resource can be marked as deleted; Knora does this by adding the predicate kb:isDeleted true to the resource. An optional kb:deleteComment may be added to explain why the resource has been marked as deleted. Deleted resources are normally hidden. They cannot be undeleted, because even though resources are not versioned, it is necessary to be able to find out when a resource was deleted. If desired, a new resource can be created by copying data from a deleted resource. Properties of Resource creationDate (1) : The time when the resource was created. attachedToUser (1) : The user who owns the resource. attachedToProject (1) : The project that the resource is part of. lastModificationDate (0-1) : A timestamp indicating when the resource (or one of its values) was last modified. seqnum (0-1) : The sequence number of the resource, if it is part of an ordered group of resources, such as the pages in a book. isDeleted (1) : Indicates whether the resource has been deleted. deleteDate (0-1) : If the resource has been deleted, indicates when it was deleted. deleteComment (0-1) : If the resource has been deleted, indicates why it was deleted. Resources can have properties that point to other resources; see Links Between Resources . A resource grants permissions to groups of users; see Authorisation . Representations It is not practical to store all data in RDF. In particular, RDF is not a good storage medium for binary data such as images. Therefore, Knora stores such data outside the triplestore, in ordinary files. A resource can have metadata about a file attached to it. The technical term for such a resource in Knora is a Representation . For each file, there is a kb:FileValue in the triplestore containing metadata about the file (see FileValue ). Knora uses Sipi to store files. The Knora APIs provide ways to create file values using Knora and Sipi. A resource that has a file value must belong to one of the subclasses of kb:Representation . Its subclasses include: StillImageRepresentation : A representation containing a still image file. MovingImageRepresentation : A representation containing a video file. AudioRepresentation : A representation containing an audio file. DDDrepresentation : A representation containing a 3D image file. TextRepresentation : A representation containing a formatted text file, such as an XML file. DocumentRepresentation : A representation containing a document (such as a PDF file) that is not a text file. These classes can be used directly in data, but it is often better to make subclasses of them, to include metadata about the files being stored. The base class of all these classes is Representation , which is not intended to be used directly. It has this property, which its subclasses override: hasFileValue (1) : Points to a file value. There are two ways for a project to design classes for representations. The simpler way is to create a resource class that represents a thing in the world (such as ex:Painting ) and also belongs to a subclass of Representation . This is adequate if the class can have only one type of file attached to it. For example, if paintings are represented only by still images, ex:Painting could be a subclass of StillImageRepresentation . This is the only approach supported in Knora API v1 . The more flexible approach, which is supported by Knora API v2 , is for each ex:Painting to link (using kb:hasRepresentation or a subproperty) to other resources containing files that represent the painting. Each of these other resources can extend a different subclass of Representation . For example, a painting could have a StillImageRepresentation as well as a DDDrepresentation . Standard Resource Classes In general, each project using Knora must define its own subclasses of kb:Resource . However, the Knora base ontology provides some standard subclasses of kb:Resource , which are intended to be used by any project: Region : Represents a region of a Representation (see Representations ). Annotation : Represents an annotation of a resource. The hasComment property points to the text of the annotation, represented as a kb:TextValue . LinkObj : Represents a link that connects two or more resources. A LinkObj has a hasLinkTo property pointing to each resource that it connects, as well as a hasLinkToValue property pointing to a reification of each of these direct links (see Links Between Resources ). A LinkObj is more complex (and hence less convenient and readable) than a simple direct link, but it has the advantage that it can be annotated using an Annotation . For improved readability, a project can make its own subclasses of LinkObj with specific meanings. Values The Knora base ontology defines a set of OWL classes that are derived from kb:Value and represent different types of structured values found in humanities data. This set of classes may not be extended by user-created ontologies. A value is always part of one particular resource, which points to it using some property derived from hasValue . For example, a user-created ontology could specify a Book class with a property hasSummary (derived from hasValue ), and that property could have a knora-base:objectClassConstraint of TextValue . This would mean that the summary of each book is represented as a TextValue . Knora values are versioned. Existing values are not modified. Instead, a new version of an existing value is created. The new version is linked to the old version via the previousValue property. Since each value version has a different IRI, there is no IRI that can be used to cite the value, such that it will always refer to the latest version of the value. Therefore, the latest version of each value has a separate UUID, as the object of the property valueHasUUID . When a new version of the value is created, this UUID is moved to the new version. This makes it possible to cite the latest version of a value by searching for the UUID. \"Deleting\" a value means marking it with kb:isDeleted . An optional kb:deleteComment may be added to explain why the value has been marked as deleted. Deleted values are normally hidden. Most types of values are marked as deleted without creating a new version of the value. However, link values must be treated as a special case. Before a LinkValue can be marked as deleted, its reference count must be decremented to 0. Therefore, a new version of the LinkValue is made, with a reference count of 0, and it is this new version that is marked as deleted. To simplify the enforcement of ontology constraints, and for consistency with resource updates, no new versions of a deleted value can be made; it is not possible to undelete. Instead, if desired, a new value can be created by copying data from a deleted value. Properties of Value valueCreationDate (1) : The date and time when the value was created. attachedToUser (1) : The user who owns the value. valueHasString (1) : A human-readable string representation of the value's contents, which is available to Knora's full-text search index. valueHasOrder (0-1) : A resource may have several properties of the same type with different values (which will be of the same class), and it may be necessary to indicate an order in which these values occur. For example, a book may have several authors which should appear in a defined order. Hence, valueHasOrder , when present, points to an integer literal indicating the order of a given value relative to the other values of the same property. These integers will not necessarily start at any particular number, and will not necessarily be consecutive. previousValue (0-1) : The previous version of the value. valueHasUUID (0-1) : The UUID that refers to all versions of the value. Only the latest version of the value has this property. isDeleted (1) : Indicates whether the value has been deleted. deleteDate (0-1) : If the value has been deleted, indicates when it was deleted. deleteComment (0-1) : If the value has been deleted, indicates why it was deleted. Each Knora value can grant permissions (see Authorisation ). Subclasses of Value TextValue Represents text, possibly including markup. The text is the object of the valueHasString property. A line break is represented as a Unicode line feed character ( U+000A ). The non-printing Unicode character INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO (U+001E) can be used to separate words that are separated only by standoff markup (see below), so they are recognised as separate in a full-text search index. Markup is stored using this property: valueHasStandoff (0-n) : Points to a standoff markup tag. See Text with Standoff Markup . valueHasMapping (0-1) : Points to the mapping used to create the standoff markup and to convert it back to the original XML. See Mapping to Create Standoff From XML . A text value can have a specified language: valueHasLanguage (0-1) : is an ISO 639-1 code as string specifying the language of the text. DateValue Humanities data includes many different types of dates. In Knora, a date has a specified calendar, and is always represented as a period with start and end points (which may be equal), each of which has a precision ( DAY , MONTH , or YEAR ). For GREGORIAN and JULIAN calendars, an optional ERA indicator term ( BCE , CE , or BC , AD ) can be added to the date, when no era is provided the default era AD will be considered. Internally, the start and end points are stored as two Julian Day Numbers. This calendar-independent representation makes it possible to compare and search for dates regardless of the calendar in which they were entered. Properties: valueHasCalendar (1) : The name of the calendar in which the date should be displayed. Currently GREGORIAN , JULIAN , and ISLAMIC civil calendars are supported. valueHasStartJDN (1) : The Julian Day Number of the start of the period (an xsd:integer ). valueHasStartPrecision (1) : The precision of the start of the period. valueHasEndJDN (1) : The Julian Day Number of the end of the period (an xsd:integer ). valueHasEndPrecision (1) : The precision of the end of the period. TimeValue A Knora time value represents a precise moment in time in the Gregorian calendar. Since nanosecond precision can be included, it is suitable for use as a timestamp. Properties: valueHasTimeStamp (1) : An xsd:dateTimeStamp , stored as an xsd:dateTime (because SPARQL does not support xsd:dateTimeStamp ). IntValue Represents an integer. Property: valueHasInteger (1) : An xsd:integer . ColorValue valueHasColor (1) : A string representing a color. The string encodes a color as hexadecimal RGB values, e.g. \\\"#FF0000\\\". DecimalValue Represents an arbitrary-precision decimal number. Property: valueHasDecimal (1) : An xsd:decimal . UriValue Represents a non-Knora URI. Property: valueHasUri (1) : An xsd:anyURI . BooleanValue Represents a boolean value. Property: valueHasBoolean (1) : An xsd:boolean . GeomValue Represents a geometrical object as a JSON string, using normalized coordinates. Property: valueHasGeometry (1) : A JSON string. GeonameValue Represents a geolocation, using the identifiers found at GeoNames . Property: valueHasGeonameCode (1) : the identifier of a geographical feature from GeoNames , represented as an xsd:string . IntervalValue Represents a time interval, with precise start and end times on a timeline, e.g. relative to the beginning of an audio or video file. Properties: valueHasIntervalStart (1) : An xsd:decimal representing the start of the interval in seconds. valueHasIntervalEnd (1) : An xsd:decimal representing the end of the interval in seconds. ListValue Projects often need to define lists or hierarchies of categories that can be assigned to many different resources. Then, for example, a user interface can provide a drop-down menu to allow the user to assign a category to a resource. The ListValue class provides a way to represent these sorts of data structures. It can represent either a flat list or a tree. A ListValue has this property: valueHasListNode (1) : Points to a ListNode . Each ListNode can have the following properties: isRootNode (0-1) : Set to true if this is the root node. hasSubListNode (0-n) : Points to the node's child nodes, if any. hasRootNode (0-1) : Points to the root node of the list (absent if isRootNode is true ). listNodePosition (0-1) : An integer indicating the node's position in the list of its siblings (absent if isRootNode is true ). listNodeName (0-1) : The node's human-readable name (absent if isRootNode is true ). FileValue Knora stores certain kinds of data outside the triplestore, in files (see Representations ). Each digital object that is stored outside the triplestore has associated metadata, which is stored in the triplestore in a kb:FileValue . The base class FileValue , which is not intended to be used directly, has these properties: internalFilename (1) : The name of the file as stored by Knora. internalMimeType (1) : The MIME type of the file as stored by Knora. originalFilename (0-1) : The original name of the file when it was uploaded to the Knora API server. originalMimeType (0-1) : The original MIME type of the file when it was uploaded to the Knora API server. isPreview (0-1) : A boolean indicating whether the file is a preview, i.e. a small image representing the contents of the file. A preview is always a StillImageFileValue , regardless of the type of the enclosing Representation . The subclasses of FileValue , which are intended to be used directly in data, include: StillImageFileValue : Contains metadata about a still image file. MovingImageFileValue : Contains metadata about a video file. AudioFileValue : Contains metadata about an audio file. DDDFileValue : Contains metadata about a 3D image file. TextFileValue : Contains metadata about a text file. DocumentFileValue : Contains metadata about a document (such as PDF) that is not a text file. Each of these classes contains properties that are specific to the type of file it describes. For example, still image files have dimensions, video files have frame rates, and so on. FileValue objects are versioned like other values, and the actual files stored by Knora are also versioned. Version 1 of the Knora API does not provide a way to retrieve a previous version of a file, but this feature will be added in a subsequent version of the API. LinkValue A LinkValue is an RDF \"reification\" containing metadata about a link between two resources. It is therefore a subclass of rdf:Statement as well as of Value . It has these properties: rdf:subject (1) : The resource that is the source of the link. rdf:predicate (1) : The link property. rdf:object (1) : The resource that is the target of the link. valueHasRefCount (1) : The reference count of the link. This is meaningful when the LinkValue describes resource references in Standoff text markup (see StandoffLinkTag ). Otherwise, the reference count will always be 1 (if the link exists) or 0 (if it has been deleted). For details about how links are created in Knora, see Links Between Resources . ExternalResValue Represents a resource that is not stored in the RDF triplestore managed by Knora, but instead resides in an external repository managed by some other software. The ExternalResValue contains the information that Knora needs in order to access the resource, assuming that a suitable gateway plugin is installed. extResAccessInfo (1) : The location of the repository containing the external resource (e.g. its URL). extResId (1) : The repository-specific ID of the external resource. extResProvider (1) : The name of the external provider of the resource. Links Between Resources A link between two resources is expressed, first of all, as a triple, in which the subject is the resource that is the source of the link, the predicate is a \"link property\" (a subproperty of kb:hasLinkTo ), and the object is the resource that is the target of the link. It is also useful to store metadata about links. For example, Knora needs to know who owns the link, who has permission to modify it, when it was created, and so on. Such metadata cannot simply describe the link property, because then it would refer to that property in general, not to any particular instance in which that property is used to connect two particular resources. To attach metadata to a specific link in RDF, it is necessary to create an RDF \"reification\". A reification makes statements about a particular triple (subject, predicate, object), in this case the triple that expresses the link between the resources. Knora uses reifications of type kb:LinkValue (described in LinkValue to store metadata about links. For example, suppose a project describes paintings that belong to collections. The project can define an ontology as follows (expressed here in Turtle format, and simplified for the purposes of illustration): @prefix kb <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> . @prefix : <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings#> . :Painting rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf kb:Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasArtist ; owl:cardinality 1 ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasTitle ; owl:cardinality 1 ] ; [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :isInCollection ; owl:minCardinality 1 ] ; [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :isInCollectionValue ; owl:minCardinality 1 ] . :Collection rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf kb:Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasCollectionName ; owl:cardinality 1 ] . :hasArtist rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:label \"Name of artist\" ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue . :hasTitle rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:label \"Title of painting\" kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue . :hasCollectionName rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:label \"Name of collection\" ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Collection ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue . To link the paintings to the collection, we must add a \"link property\" to the ontology. In this case, the link property will point from a painting to the collection it belongs to. Every link property must be a subproperty of kb:hasLinkTo . :isInCollection rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:hasLinkTo ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint :Collection . We must then add a \"link value property\", which will point from a painting to a kb:LinkValue (described in LinkValue ), which will contain metadata about the link between the property and the collection. In particular, the link value specifies the creator of the link, the date when it was created, and the permissions that determine who can view or modify it. The name of the link value property is constructed using a simple naming convention: the word Value is appended to the name of the link property. In this case, since our link property is called :isInCollection , the link value property must be called :isInCollectionValue . Every link value property must be a subproperty of kb:hasLinkToValue . :isInCollectionValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:hasLinkToValue ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:LinkValue . Given this ontology, we can create some RDF data describing a painting and a collection: @prefix paintings <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings#> . @prefix data <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings/data#> . data:dali_4587 rdf:type paintings:Painting ; paintings:hasTitle data:value_A ; paintings:hasArtist data:value_B . data:value_A rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"The Persistence of Memory\" . data:value_B rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"Salvador Dali\" . data:pompidou rdf:type paintings:Collection ; paintings:hasCollectionName data:value_C . data:value_C rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"Centre Pompidou, Paris\" . We can then state that the painting is in the collection: data:dali_4587 paintings:isInCollection data:pompidou ; paintings:isinCollectionValue data:value_D . data:value_D rdf:type kb:LinkValue ; rdf:subject data:dali_4587 ; rdf:predicate paintings:isInCollection ; rdf:object data:pompidou ; kb:valueHasRefCount 1 . This creates a link ( paintings:isInCollection ) between the painting and the collection, along with a reification containing metadata about the link. We can visualise the result as the following graph: Knora allows a user to see a link if the requesting user has permission to see the source and target resources as well as the kb:LinkValue . Text with Standoff Markup Knora is designed to be able to store text with markup, which can indicate formatting and structure, as well as the complex observations involved in transcribing handwritten manuscripts. One popular way of representing text in the humanities is to encode it in XML using the Text Encoding Initiative ( TEI ) guidelines. In Knora, a TEI/XML document can be stored as a file with attached metadata, but this is not recommended, because it does not allow Knora to perform searches across multiple documents. The recommended way to store text with markup in Knora is to use Knora's built-in support for \"standoff\" markup, which is stored separately from the text. This has some advantages over embedded markup such as XML. While XML requires markup to have a hierarchical structure, and does not allow overlapping tags, standoff nodes do not have these limitations (see Using Standoff Properties for Marking-up Historical Documents in the Humanities ). A standoff tag can be attached to any substring in the text by giving its start and end positions. Unlike in corpus linguistics, we do not use any tokenisation resulting in a form of predefined segmentation, which would limit the user's ability to freely annotate any ranges in the text. For example, suppose we have the following text: This sentence has overlapping visual attributes. This would require just two standoff tags: (italic, start=5, end=29) and (bold, start=14, end=36) . Moreover, standoff makes it possible to mark up the same text in different, possibly incompatible ways, allowing for different interpretations without making redundant copies of the text. In the Knora base ontology, any text value can have standoff tags. By representing standoff as RDF triples, Knora makes markup searchable across multiple text documents in a repository. For example, if a repository contains documents in which references to persons are indicated in standoff, it is straightforward to find all the documents mentioning a particular person. Knora's standoff support is intended to make it possible to convert documents with embedded, hierarchical markup, such as TEI/XML, into RDF standoff and back again, with no data loss, thus bringing the benefits of RDF to existing TEI-encoded documents. In the Knora base ontology, a TextValue can have one or more standoff tags. Each standoff tag indicates the start and end positions of a substring in the text that has a particular attribute. The OWL class kb:StandoffTag , which is the base class of all standoff node classes, has these properties: standoffTagHasStart (1) : The index of the first character in the text that has the attribute. standoffTagHasEnd (1) : The index of the last character in the text that has the attribute, plus 1. standoffTagHasUUID (1) : A UUID identifying this instance and those corresponding to it in later versions of the TextValue it belongs to. The UUID is a means to maintain a reference to a particular range of a text also when new versions are made and standoff tag IRIs change. standoffTagHasOriginalXMLID (0-1) : The original id of the XML element that the standoff tag represents, if any. standoffTagHasStartIndex (1) : The start index of the standoff tag. Start indexes are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular text. When several standoff tags share the same start position, they can be nested correctly with this information when transforming them to XML. standoffTagHasEndIndex (1) : The end index of the standoff tag. Start indexes are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular text. When several standoff tags share the same end position, they can be nested correctly with this information when transforming them to XML. standoffTagHasStartParent (0-1) : Points to the parent standoff tag. This corresponds to the original nesting of tags in XML. If a standoff tag has no parent, it represents the XML root element. If the original XML element is a CLIX tag, it represents the start of a virtual (non syntactical) hierarchy. standoffTagHasEndParent (0-1) : Points to the parent standoff tag if the original XML element is a CLIX tag and represents the end of a virtual (non syntactical) hierarchy. The StandoffTag class is not used directly in RDF data; instead, its subclasses are used. A few subclasses are currently provided in standoff-onto.ttl , and more will be added to support TEI semantics. Projects are able to define their own custom standoff tag classes (direct subclasses of StandoffTag or one of the standoff data type classes or subclasses of one of the standoff classes defined in standoff-onto.ttl ). Subclasses of StandoffTag Standoff Data Type Tags Associates data in some Knora value type with a substring in a text. Standoff data type tags are subclasses of ValueBase classes. StandoffLinkTag Indicates that a substring refers to another kb:Resource . See StandoffLinkTag . StandoffInternalReferenceTag Indicates that a substring refers to another standoff tag in the same text value. See Internal Links in a TextValue . StandoffUriTag Indicates that a substring is associated with a URI, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:UriValue . See UriValue . StandoffDateTag Indicates that a substring represents a date, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:DateValue . See DateValue . StandoffColorTag Indicates that a substring represents a color, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:ColorValue . See ColorValue . StandoffIntegerTag Indicates that a substring represents an integer, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:IntegerValue . See IntValue . StandoffDecimalTag Indicates that a substring represents a number with fractions, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:DecimalValue . See DecimalValue . StandoffIntervalTag Indicates that a substring represents an interval, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:IntervalValue . See IntervalValue . StandoffBooleanTag Indicates that a substring represents a Boolean, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:BooleanValue . See BooleanValue . StandoffTimeTag Indicates that a substring represents a timestamp, which is stored in the same form that is used for kb:TimeValue . See TimeValue . StandoffLinkTag A StandoffLinkTag Indicates that a substring is associated with a Knora resource. For example, if a repository contains resources representing persons, a text could be marked up so that each time a person's name is mentioned, a StandoffLinkTag connects the name to the Knora resource describing that person. Property: standoffTagHasLink (1) : The IRI of the resource that is referred to. One of the design goals of the Knora ontology is to make it easy and efficient to find out which resources contain references to a given resource. Direct links are easier and more efficient to query than indirect links. Therefore, when a text value contains a resource reference in its standoff nodes, Knora automatically creates a direct link between the containing resource and the target resource, along with an RDF reification (a kb:LinkValue ) describing the link, as discussed in Links Between Resources . In this case, the link property is always kb:hasStandoffLinkTo , and the link value property (which points to the LinkValue ) is always kb:hasStandoffLinkToValue . Knora automatically updates direct links and reifications for standoff resource references when text values are updated. To do this, it keeps track of the number of text values in each resource that contain at least one standoff reference to a given target resource. It stores this number as the reference count of the LinkValue (see LinkValue ) describing the direct link. Each time this number changes, it makes a new version of the LinkValue , with an updated reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, it removes the direct link and makes a new version of the LinkValue , marked with kb:isDeleted . For example, if data:R1 is a resource with a text value in which the resource data:R2 is referenced, the repository could contain the following triples: data:R1 ex:hasComment data:V1 . data:V1 rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"This link is internal.\" ; kb:valueHasStandoff data:SO1 . data:SO1 rdf:type kb:StandoffLinkTag ; kb:standoffTagHasStart: 5 ; kb:standoffTagHasEnd: 9 ; kb:standoffTagHasLink data:R2 . data:R1 kb:hasStandoffLinkTo data:R2 . data:R1 kb:hasStandoffLinkToValue data:LV1 . data:LV1 rdf:type kb:LinkValue ; rdf:subject data:R1 ; rdf:predicate kb:hasStandoffLinkTo ; rdf:object data:R2 ; kb:valueHasRefCount 1 . The result can be visualized like this: Link values created automatically for resource references in standoff are visible to all users, and the creator of these link values is always kb:SystemUser (see Users and Groups ). The Knora API server allows a user to see a standoff link if the user has permission to see the source and target resources. Internal Links in a TextValue Internal links in a TextValue can be represented using the data type standoff class StandoffInternalReferenceTag or a subclass of it. It has the following property: standoffTagHasInternalReference (1) : Points to a StandoffTag that belongs to the same TextValue . It has an objectClassConstraint of StandoffTag . For links to a kb:Resource , see StandoffLinkTag . Mapping to Create Standoff From XML A mapping allows for the conversion of an XML document to RDF-standoff and back. A mapping defines one-to-one relations between XML elements (with or without a class) and attributes and standoff classes and properties (see XML to Standoff Mapping ). A mapping is represented by a kb:XMLToStandoffMapping which contains one or more kb:MappingElement . A kb:MappingElement maps an XML element (including attributes) to a standoff class and standoff properties. It has the following properties: mappingHasXMLTagname (1) : The name of the XML element that is mapped to a standoff class. mappingHasXMLNamespace (1) : The XML namespace of the XML element that is mapped to a standoff class. If no namespace is given, noNamespace is used. mappingHasXMLClass (1) : The name of the class of the XML element. If it has no class, noClass is used. mappingHasStandoffClass (1) : The standoff class the XML element is mapped to. mappingHasXMLAttribute (0-n) : Maps XML attributes to standoff properties using MappingXMLAttribute . See below. mappingHasStandoffDataTypeClass (0-1) : Indicates the standoff data type class of the standoff class the XML element is mapped to. mappingElementRequiresSeparator (1) : Indicates if there should be an invisible word separator inserted after the XML element in the RDF-standoff representation. Once the markup is stripped, text segments that belonged to different elements may be concatenated. A MappingXMLAttribute has the following properties: mappingHasXMLAttributename : The name of the XML attribute that is mapped to a standoff property. mappingHasXMLNamespace : The namespace of the XML attribute that is mapped to a standoff property. If no namespace is given, noNamespace is used. mappingHasStandoffProperty : The standoff property the XML attribute is mapped to. Knora includes a standard mapping used by the SALSAH GUI. It has the IRI http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping and defines mappings for a few elements used to write texts with simple markup. Standoff in Digital Editions Knora's standoff is designed to make it possible to convert XML documents to standoff and back. One application for this feature is an editing workflow in which an editor works in an XML editor, and the resulting XML documents are converted to standoff and stored in Knora, where they can be searched and annotated. If an editor wants to correct text that has been imported from XML into standoff, the text can be exported as XML, edited, and imported again. To preserve annotations on standoff tags across edits, each tag can automatically be given a UUID. In a future version of the Knora base ontology, it will be possible to create annotations that point to UUIDs rather than to IRIs. When a text is exported to XML, the UUIDs can be included in the XML. When the edited XML is imported again, it can be converted to new standoff tags with the same UUIDs. Annotations that applied to standoff tags in the previous version of the text will therefore also apply to equivalent tags in the new version. When text is converted from XML into standoff, tags are also given indexes, which are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular text. This makes it possible to order tags that share the same position, and to preserve the hierarchy of the original XML document. An ordinary, hierarchical XML tag is converted to a standoff tag that has one index, as well as the index of its parent tag, if any. The Knora base ontology also supports non-hierarchical markup such as CLIX , which enables overlapping markup to be represented in XML. When non-hierarchical markup is converted to standoff, both the start position and the end position of the standoff tag have indexes and parent indexes. To support these features, a standoff tag can have these additional properties: standoffTagHasStartIndex (0-1) : The index of the start position. standoffTagHasEndIndex (0-1) : The index of the end position, if this is a non-hierarchical tag. standoffTagHasStartParent (0-1) : The IRI of the tag, if any, that contains the start position. standoffTagHasEndParent (0-1) : The IRI of the tag, if any, that contains the end position, if this is a non-hierarchical tag. standoffTagHasUUID (0-1) : A UUID that can be used to annotate a standoff tag that may be present in different versions of a text, or in different layers of a text (such as a diplomatic transcription and an edited critical text). Querying Standoff in SPARQL A future version of Knora will provide an API for querying standoff markup. In the meantime, it is possible to query it directly in SPARQL. For example, here is a SPARQL query (using RDFS inference) that finds all the text values texts that have a standoff date tag referring to Christmas Eve 2016, contained in a StandoffItalicTag : PREFIX knora-base: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> PREFIX standoff: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#> select * where { ?standoffTag a knora-base:StandoffDateTag . ?standoffTag knora-base:valueHasStartJDN ?dateStart . ?standoffTag knora-base:valueHasEndJDN ?dateEnd . FILTER (2457747 <= ?dateEnd && 2457747 >= ?dateStart) ?standoffTag knora-base:standoffTagHasStartParent ?parent . ?parent a standoff:StandoffItalicTag . ?textValue knora-base:valueHasStandoff ?standoffTag . ?textValue knora-base:valueHasString ?string . ?standoffTag knora-base:standoffTagHasStart ?startPos . ?standoffTag knora-base:standoffTagHasEnd ?endPos . } Authorisation Users and Groups Each Knora user is represented by an object belonging to the class kb:User , which is a subclass of foaf:Person , and has the following properties: userid (1) : A unique identifier that the user must provide when logging in. password (1) : A cryptographic hash of the user's password. email (0-n) : Email addresses belonging to the user. isInProject (0-n) : Projects that the user is a member of. isInGroup (0-n) : user-created groups that the user is a member of. foaf:familyName (1) : The user's family name. foaf:givenName (1) : The user's given name. Knora's concept of access control is that an object (a resource or value) can grant permissions to groups of users (but not to individual users). There are several built-in groups: knora-admin:UnknownUser : Any user who has not logged into Knora is automatically assigned to this group. knora-admin:KnownUser : Any user who has logged into Knora is automatically assigned to this group. knora-admin:ProjectMember : When checking a user's permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if she is a member of the project that the object belongs to. knora-admin:Creator : When checking a user's permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if he is the creator of the object. knora-admin:ProjectAdmin : When checking a user's permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if she is an administrator of the project that the object belongs to. knora-admin:SystemAdmin : The group of Knora system administrators. A user-created ontology can define additional groups, which must belong to the OWL class knora-admin:UserGroup . There is one built-in knora-admin:SystemUser , which is the creator of link values created automatically for resource references in standoff markup (see StandoffLinkTag ). Permissions Each resource or value can grant certain permissions to specified user groups. These permissions are represented as the object of the predicate kb:hasPermissions , which is required on every kb:Resource and on the current version of every kb:Value . The permissions attached to the current version of a value also apply to previous versions of the value. Value versions other than the current one do not have this predicate. The following permissions can be granted: Restricted view permission (RV) Allows a restricted view of the object, e.g. a view of an image with a watermark. View permission (V) Allows an unrestricted view of the object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the user's ability to view information about the resource other than its values. To view a value, she must have view permission on the value itself. Modify permission (M) For values, this permission allows a new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows the user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an existing value), or to change information about the resource other than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value, his permissions on the containing resource are not relevant. However, when he wants to change the target of a link, the old link must be deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify permission on the resource. Delete permission (D) Allows the item to be marked as deleted. Change rights permission (CR) Allows the permissions granted by the object to be changed. Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered permissions. A user's permission level on a particular object is calculated in the following way: Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including Creator and/or ProjectMember if applicable. Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the object, by iterating over the permissions that the object grants. For each permission, if she is in the specified group, add the specified permission to the list of permissions she can obtain. From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission. If the result is that she would have no permissions, give her whatever permission UnknownUser would have. To view a link between resources, a user needs permission to view the source and target resources. He also needs permission to view the LinkValue representing the link, unless the link property is hasStandoffLinkTo (see StandoffLinkTag ). The format of the object of kb:hasPermissions is as follows: Each permission is represented by the one-letter or two-letter abbreviation given above. Each permission abbreviation is followed by a space, then a comma-separated list of groups that the permission is granted to. The IRIs of built-in groups are shortened using the knora-admin prefix. Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar ( | ). For example, if an object grants view permission to unknown and known users, and modify permission to project members, the resulting permission literal would be: V knora-admin:UnknownUser,knora-admin:KnownUser|M knora-admin:ProjectMember Consistency Checking Knora tries to enforce repository consistency by checking constraints that are specified in the Knora base ontology and in user-created ontologies. Three types of consistency rules are enforced: Cardinalities in OWL class definitions must be satisfied. Constraints on the types of the subjects and objects of OWL object properties must be satisfied. A datatype property may not have an empty string as an object. The implementation of consistency checking is partly triplestore-dependent; Knora may be able to provide stricter checks with some triplestores than with others. OWL Cardinalities As noted in Resources , each subclass of Resource must use OWL cardinality restrictions to specify the properties it can have. More specifically, a resource is allowed to have a property that is a subproperty of kb:hasValue or kb:hasLinkTo only if the resource's class has some cardinality for that property. Similarly, a value is allowed to have a subproperty of kb:valueHas only if the value's class has some cardinality for that property. Knora supports, and attempts to enforce, the following cardinality constraints: owl:cardinality 1 : A resource of this class must have exactly one instance of the specified property. owl:minCardinality 1 : A resource of this class must have at least one instance of the specified property. owl:maxCardinality 1 : A resource of this class may have zero or one instance of the specified property. owl:minCardinality 0 : A resource of this class may have zero or more instances of the specified property. Knora requires cardinalities to be defined using blank nodes, as in the following example from knora-base : :Representation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] . :StillImageRepresentation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Representation , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasStillImageFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] . The cardinality of a link property must be the same as the cardinality of the corresponding link value property. Each owl:Restriction may have the predicate salsah-gui:guiOrder to indicate the order in which properties should be displayed in a GUI (see The SALSAH GUI Ontology ). A resource class inherits cardinalities from its superclasses. This follows from the rules of RDFS inference. Also, in Knora, cardinalities in the subclass can override cardinalities that would otherwise be inherited from the superclass. Specifically, if a superclass has a cardinality on a property P, and a subclass has a cardinality on a subproperty of P, the subclass's cardinality overrides the superclass's cardinality. In the example above, hasStillImageFileValue is a subproperty of hasFileValue . Therefore, the cardinality on hasStillImageFileValue overrides (i.e. replaces) the one on hasFileValue . Note that, unlike cardinalities, predicates of properties are not inherited. If :foo rdfs:subPropertyOf :bar , this does not mean that :foo inherits anything from :bar . Any predicates of :foo that are also needed by :bar must be defined explicitly on :bar . This design decision was made because property predicate inheritance is not provided by RDFS inference, and would make it more difficult to check the correctness of ontologies, while providing little practical benefit. For more information about OWL cardinalities, see the OWL 2 Primer . Constraints on the Types of Property Subjects and Objects When a user-created ontology defines a property, it must indicate the types that are allowed as objects (and, if possible, as subjects) of the property. This is done using the following Knora-specific properties: subjectClassConstraint : Specifies the class that subjects of the property must belong to. This constraint is recommended but not required. Knora will attempt to enforce this constraint. objectClassConstraint : If the property is an object property, specifies the class that objects of the property must belong to. Every subproperty of kb:hasValue or a kb:hasLinkTo (i.e. every property of a resource that points to a kb:Value or to another resource) is required to have this constraint, because Knora relies on it to know what type of object to expect for the property. Knora will attempt to enforce this constraint. objectDatatypeConstraint : If the property is a datatype property, specifies the type of literals that can be objects of the property. Knora will not attempt to enforce this constraint, but it is useful for documentation purposes. Note that it is possible for a subproperty to have a more restrictive contraint than its base property, by specifing a subject or object class that is a subclass of the one specified in the base property. However, it is not possible for the subproperty to make the base property's constraint less restrictive. See also Why doesn\u2019t Knora use rdfs:domain and rdfs:range for consistency checking? Consistency Constraint Example A user-created ontology could define consistency constraints as in this simplified example: :book rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasTitle ; owl:cardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasAuthor ; owl:minCardinality \"0\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] . :hasTitle rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue . :hasAuthor rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book ; knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue . Summary of Restrictions on User-Created Ontologies An ontology can refer to a Knora ontology in another project only if the other ontology is built-in or shared (see Shared Ontologies ). Restrictions on Classes Each class must be a subclass of either kb:Resource or kb:StandoffTag , but not both (note that this forbids user-created subclasses of kb:Value ). All the cardinalities that a class defines directly (i.e. does not inherit from kb:Resource ) must be on properties that are defined in the triplestore. Within the cardinalities of a class, there must be a link value property for each link property and vice versa. The cardinality of a link property must be the same as the cardinality of the corresponding link value property. A cardinality on a property with a boolean value must be owl:cardinality 1 or owl:maxCardinality 1 . Each class must be a subclass of all the classes that are subject class constraints of the properties in its cardinalities. If it's a resource class, all its directly defined cardinalities must be on Knora resource properties (subproperties of kb:hasValue or kb:hasLinkTo ), and all its base classes with Knora IRIs must also be resource classes. A cardinality on kb:resourceProperty or kb:hasValue is forbidden. It must also have an rdfs:label . If it's a standoff class, none of its cardinalities may be on Knora resource properties, and all its base classes with Knora IRIs must also be standoff classes. A class cannot have a cardinality on property P as well as a cardinality on a subproperty of P. Restrictions on properties The property's subject class constraint, if provided, must be a subclass of kb:Resource or kb:StandoffTag , and must be a subclass of the subject class constraints of all its base properties. Its object class constraint, if provided, must be a subclass of the object class constraints of all its base properties. If the property is a Knora resource property, it must have an object class constraint and an rdfs:label . It can't be a subproperty of both kb:hasValue and kb:hasLinkTo . It can't be a subproperty of kb:hasFileValue . Each of its base properties that has a Knora IRI must also be a Knora resource property. Standardisation The DaSCH intends to coordinate the standardisation of generally useful entities proposed in user-created ontologies. We envisage a process in which two or more projects would initiate the process by starting a public discussion on proposed entities to be shared. Once a consensus was reached, the DaSCH would publish these entities in a shared ontology ). Knora Ontology Versions The Knora base ontology has the property kb:ontologyVersion , whose object is a string that indicates the deployed version of all the Knora built-in ontologies. This allows the repository update program to determine which repository updates are needed when Knora is upgraded.","title":"The Knora Base Ontology"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#the-knora-base-ontology","text":"","title":"The Knora Base Ontology"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#overview","text":"The Knora base ontology is the main built-in Knora ontology.

Each project using the Knora base ontology must define its own OWL classes, derived from kb:Resource , to represent the types of data it deals with. A subclass of kb:Resource may additionally be a subclass of any other class, e.g. an industry-standard class such as foaf:Person ; this can facilitate searches across projects. Resources have properties that point to different parts of the content they contain. For example, a resource representing a book could have a property called hasAuthor , pointing to the author of the book. There are two possible kinds of content in a Knora resource: Knora values (see Values ) or links to other resources (see Links Between Resources ). Properties that point to Knora values must be subproperties of kb:hasValue , and properties that point to other resources must be subproperties of kb:hasLinkTo . Either of these two types of properties may also be a subproperty of any other property, e.g. an industry-standard property such as foaf:name ; this can facilitate searches across projects. Each property definition must specify the types that its subjects and objects must belong to (see Constraints on the Types of Property Subjects and Objects for details). Each user-created resource class definition must use OWL cardinality restrictions to specify the properties that resources of that class can have (see OWL Cardinalities for details). Resources are not versioned; only their values are versioned (see Values ). Every resource is required to have an rdfs:label . The object of this property is an xsd:string , rather than a Knora value; hence it is not versioned. A user who has modify permission on a resource (see Authorisation ) can change its label. A resource can be marked as deleted; Knora does this by adding the predicate kb:isDeleted true to the resource. An optional kb:deleteComment may be added to explain why the resource has been marked as deleted. Deleted resources are normally hidden. They cannot be undeleted, because even though resources are not versioned, it is necessary to be able to find out when a resource was deleted.

In particular, RDF is not a good storage medium for binary data such as images. Therefore, Knora stores such data outside the triplestore, in ordinary files. A resource can have metadata about a file attached to it. The technical term for such a resource in Knora is a Representation . For each file, there is a kb:FileValue in the triplestore containing metadata about the file (see FileValue ). Knora uses Sipi to store files. The Knora APIs provide ways to create file values using Knora and Sipi. A resource that has a file value must belong to one of the subclasses of kb:Representation . Its subclasses include: StillImageRepresentation : A representation containing a still image file. MovingImageRepresentation : A representation containing a video file. AudioRepresentation : A representation containing an audio file. DDDrepresentation : A representation containing a 3D image file. TextRepresentation : A representation containing a formatted text file, such as an XML file. DocumentRepresentation : A representation containing a document (such as a PDF file) that is not a text file. These classes can be used directly in data, but it is often better to make subclasses of them, to include metadata about the files being stored. The base class of all these classes is Representation , which is not intended to be used directly. It has this property, which its subclasses override: hasFileValue (1) : Points to a file value. There are two ways for a project to design classes for representations. The simpler way is to create a resource class that represents a thing in the world (such as ex:Painting ) and also belongs to a subclass of Representation . This is adequate if the class can have only one type of file attached to it. For example, if paintings are represented only by still images, ex:Painting could be a subclass of StillImageRepresentation . This is the only approach supported in Knora API v1 . The more flexible approach, which is supported by Knora API v2 , is for each ex:Painting to link (using kb:hasRepresentation or a subproperty) to other resources containing files that represent the painting. Each of these other resources can extend a different subclass of Representation . For example, a painting could have a StillImageRepresentation as well as a DDDrepresentation .","title":"Representations"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#standard-resource-classes","text":"In general, each project using Knora must define its own subclasses of kb:Resource .

LinkObj : Represents a link that connects two or more resources. A LinkObj has a hasLinkTo property pointing to each resource that it connects, as well as a hasLinkToValue property pointing to a reification of each of these direct links (see Links Between Resources ). A LinkObj is more complex (and hence less convenient and readable) than a simple direct link, but it has the advantage that it can be annotated using an Annotation . For improved readability, a project can make its own subclasses of LinkObj with specific meanings.","title":"Standard Resource Classes"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#values","text":"The Knora base ontology defines a set of OWL classes that are derived from kb:Value and represent different types of structured values found in humanities data. This set of classes may not be extended by user-created ontologies. A value is always part of one particular resource, which points to it using some property derived from hasValue . For example, a user-created ontology could specify a Book class with a property hasSummary (derived from hasValue ), and that property could have a knora-base:objectClassConstraint of TextValue . This would mean that the summary of each book is represented as a TextValue . Knora values are versioned. Existing values are not modified. Instead, a new version of an existing value is created. The new version is linked to the old version via the previousValue property. Since each value version has a different IRI, there is no IRI that can be used to cite the value, such that it will always refer to the latest version of the value. Therefore, the latest version of each value has a separate UUID, as the object of the property valueHasUUID . When a new version of the value is created, this UUID is moved to the new version. This makes it possible to cite the latest version of a value by searching for the UUID. \"Deleting\" a value means marking it with kb:isDeleted . An optional kb:deleteComment may be added to explain why the value has been marked as deleted. Deleted values are normally hidden. Most types of values are marked as deleted without creating a new version of the value. However, link values must be treated as a special case. Before a LinkValue can be marked as deleted, its reference count must be decremented to 0. Therefore, a new version of the LinkValue is made, with a reference count of 0, and it is this new version that is marked as deleted.

It is also useful to store metadata about links. For example, Knora needs to know who owns the link, who has permission to modify it, when it was created, and so on. Such metadata cannot simply describe the link property, because then it would refer to that property in general, not to any particular instance in which that property is used to connect two particular resources. To attach metadata to a specific link in RDF, it is necessary to create an RDF \"reification\". A reification makes statements about a particular triple (subject, predicate, object), in this case the triple that expresses the link between the resources. Knora uses reifications of type kb:LinkValue (described in LinkValue to store metadata about links. For example, suppose a project describes paintings that belong to collections. The project can define an ontology as follows (expressed here in Turtle format, and simplified for the purposes of illustration): @prefix kb <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> . @prefix : <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings#> . :Painting rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf kb:Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasArtist ; owl:cardinality 1 ] , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasTitle ; owl:cardinality 1 ] ; [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :isInCollection ; owl:minCardinality 1 ] ; [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :isInCollectionValue ; owl:minCardinality 1 ] . :Collection rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf kb:Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasCollectionName ; owl:cardinality 1 ] . :hasArtist rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:label \"Name of artist\" ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue . :hasTitle rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:label \"Title of painting\" kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue . :hasCollectionName rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:label \"Name of collection\" ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Collection ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue . To link the paintings to the collection, we must add a \"link property\" to the ontology. In this case, the link property will point from a painting to the collection it belongs to. Every link property must be a subproperty of kb:hasLinkTo . :isInCollection rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:hasLinkTo ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint :Collection . We must then add a \"link value property\", which will point from a painting to a kb:LinkValue (described in LinkValue ), which will contain metadata about the link between the property and the collection. In particular, the link value specifies the creator of the link, the date when it was created, and the permissions that determine who can view or modify it. The name of the link value property is constructed using a simple naming convention: the word Value is appended to the name of the link property. In this case, since our link property is called :isInCollection , the link value property must be called :isInCollectionValue . Every link value property must be a subproperty of kb:hasLinkToValue . :isInCollectionValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:hasLinkToValue ; kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ; kb:objectClassConstraint kb:LinkValue . Given this ontology, we can create some RDF data describing a painting and a collection: @prefix paintings <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings#> . @prefix data <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings/data#> . data:dali_4587 rdf:type paintings:Painting ; paintings:hasTitle data:value_A ; paintings:hasArtist data:value_B . data:value_A rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"The Persistence of Memory\" . data:value_B rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"Salvador Dali\" . data:pompidou rdf:type paintings:Collection ; paintings:hasCollectionName data:value_C . data:value_C rdf:type kb:TextValue ; kb:valueHasString \"Centre Pompidou, Paris\" .

This creates a link ( paintings:isInCollection ) between the painting and the collection, along with a reification containing metadata about the link.

One popular way of representing text in the humanities is to encode it in XML using the Text Encoding Initiative ( TEI ) guidelines. In Knora, a TEI/XML document can be stored as a file with attached metadata, but this is not recommended, because it does not allow Knora to perform searches across multiple documents. The recommended way to store text with markup in Knora is to use Knora's built-in support for \"standoff\" markup, which is stored separately from the text. This has some advantages over embedded markup such as XML. While XML requires markup to have a hierarchical structure, and does not allow overlapping tags, standoff nodes do not have these limitations (see Using Standoff Properties for Marking-up Historical Documents in the Humanities ). A standoff tag can be attached to any substring in the text by giving its start and end positions. Unlike in corpus linguistics, we do not use any tokenisation resulting in a form of predefined segmentation, which would limit the user's ability to freely annotate any ranges in the text. For example, suppose we have the following text: This sentence has overlapping visual attributes. This would require just two standoff tags: (italic, start=5, end=29) and (bold, start=14, end=36) . Moreover, standoff makes it possible to mark up the same text in different, possibly incompatible ways, allowing for different interpretations without making redundant copies of the text. In the Knora base ontology, any text value can have standoff tags. By representing standoff as RDF triples, Knora makes markup searchable across multiple text documents in a repository. For example, if a repository contains documents in which references to persons are indicated in standoff, it is straightforward to find all the documents mentioning a particular person. Knora's standoff support is intended to make it possible to convert documents with embedded, hierarchical markup, such as TEI/XML, into RDF standoff and back again, with no data loss, thus bringing the benefits of RDF to existing TEI-encoded documents. In the Knora base ontology, a TextValue can have one or more standoff tags. Each standoff tag indicates the start and end positions of a substring in the text that has a particular attribute. The OWL class kb:StandoffTag , which is the base class of all standoff node classes, has these properties: standoffTagHasStart (1) : The index of the first character in the text that has the attribute. standoffTagHasEnd (1) : The index of the last character in the text that has the attribute, plus 1. standoffTagHasUUID (1) : A UUID identifying this instance and those corresponding to it in later versions of the TextValue it belongs to. The UUID is a means to maintain a reference to a particular range of a text also when new versions are made and standoff tag IRIs change. standoffTagHasOriginalXMLID (0-1) : The original id of the XML element that the standoff tag represents, if any. standoffTagHasStartIndex (1) : The start index of the standoff tag. Start indexes are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular text. When several standoff tags share the same start position, they can be nested correctly with this information when transforming them to XML. standoffTagHasEndIndex (1) : The end index of the standoff tag. Start indexes are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular text. When several standoff tags share the same end position, they can be nested correctly with this information when transforming them to XML. standoffTagHasStartParent (0-1) : Points to the parent standoff tag. This corresponds to the original nesting of tags in XML. If a standoff tag has no parent, it represents the XML root element. If the original XML element is a CLIX tag, it represents the start of a virtual (non syntactical) hierarchy. standoffTagHasEndParent (0-1) : Points to the parent standoff tag if the original XML element is a CLIX tag and represents the end of a virtual (non syntactical) hierarchy. The StandoffTag class is not used directly in RDF data; instead, its subclasses are used. A few subclasses are currently provided in standoff-onto.ttl , and more will be added to support TEI semantics.

For example, if a repository contains resources representing persons, a text could be marked up so that each time a person's name is mentioned, a StandoffLinkTag connects the name to the Knora resource describing that person. Property: standoffTagHasLink (1) : The IRI of the resource that is referred to. One of the design goals of the Knora ontology is to make it easy and efficient to find out which resources contain references to a given resource. Direct links are easier and more efficient to query than indirect links. Therefore, when a text value contains a resource reference in its standoff nodes, Knora automatically creates a direct link between the containing resource and the target resource, along with an RDF reification (a kb:LinkValue ) describing the link, as discussed in Links Between Resources . In this case, the link property is always kb:hasStandoffLinkTo , and the link value property (which points to the LinkValue ) is always kb:hasStandoffLinkToValue . Knora automatically updates direct links and reifications for standoff resource references when text values are updated. To do this, it keeps track of the number of text values in each resource that contain at least one standoff reference to a given target resource. It stores this number as the reference count of the LinkValue (see LinkValue ) describing the direct link. Each time this number changes, it makes a new version of the LinkValue , with an updated reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, it removes the direct link and makes a new version of the LinkValue , marked with kb:isDeleted .

One application for this feature is an editing workflow in which an editor works in an XML editor, and the resulting XML documents are converted to standoff and stored in Knora, where they can be searched and annotated. If an editor wants to correct text that has been imported from XML into standoff, the text can be exported as XML, edited, and imported again. To preserve annotations on standoff tags across edits, each tag can automatically be given a UUID. In a future version of the Knora base ontology, it will be possible to create annotations that point to UUIDs rather than to IRIs. When a text is exported to XML, the UUIDs can be included in the XML. When the edited XML is imported again, it can be converted to new standoff tags with the same UUIDs. Annotations that applied to standoff tags in the previous version of the text will therefore also apply to equivalent tags in the new version. When text is converted from XML into standoff, tags are also given indexes, which are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular text. This makes it possible to order tags that share the same position, and to preserve the hierarchy of the original XML document. An ordinary, hierarchical XML tag is converted to a standoff tag that has one index, as well as the index of its parent tag, if any. The Knora base ontology also supports non-hierarchical markup such as CLIX , which enables overlapping markup to be represented in XML. When non-hierarchical markup is converted to standoff, both the start position and the end position of the standoff tag have indexes and parent indexes. To support these features, a standoff tag can have these additional properties: standoffTagHasStartIndex (0-1) : The index of the start position. standoffTagHasEndIndex (0-1) : The index of the end position, if this is a non-hierarchical tag. standoffTagHasStartParent (0-1) : The IRI of the tag, if any, that contains the start position. standoffTagHasEndParent (0-1) : The IRI of the tag, if any, that contains the end position, if this is a non-hierarchical tag. standoffTagHasUUID (0-1) : A UUID that can be used to annotate a standoff tag that may be present in different versions of a text, or in different layers of a text (such as a diplomatic transcription and an edited critical text).","title":"Standoff in Digital Editions"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#querying-standoff-in-sparql","text":"A future version of Knora will provide an API for querying standoff markup.

These permissions are represented as the object of the predicate kb:hasPermissions , which is required on every kb:Resource and on the current version of every kb:Value . The permissions attached to the current version of a value also apply to previous versions of the value. Value versions other than the current one do not have this predicate. The following permissions can be granted: Restricted view permission (RV) Allows a restricted view of the object, e.g. a view of an image with a watermark. View permission (V) Allows an unrestricted view of the object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the user's ability to view information about the resource other than its values. To view a value, she must have view permission on the value itself. Modify permission (M) For values, this permission allows a new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows the user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an existing value), or to change information about the resource other than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value, his permissions on the containing resource are not relevant. However, when he wants to change the target of a link, the old link must be deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify permission on the resource. Delete permission (D) Allows the item to be marked as deleted. Change rights permission (CR) Allows the permissions granted by the object to be changed. Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered permissions. A user's permission level on a particular object is calculated in the following way: Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including Creator and/or ProjectMember if applicable. Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the object, by iterating over the permissions that the object grants. For each permission, if she is in the specified group, add the specified permission to the list of permissions she can obtain. From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission. If the result is that she would have no permissions, give her whatever permission UnknownUser would have. To view a link between resources, a user needs permission to view the source and target resources. He also needs permission to view the LinkValue representing the link, unless the link property is hasStandoffLinkTo (see StandoffLinkTag ). The format of the object of kb:hasPermissions is as follows: Each permission is represented by the one-letter or two-letter abbreviation given above. Each permission abbreviation is followed by a space, then a comma-separated list of groups that the permission is granted to. The IRIs of built-in groups are shortened using the knora-admin prefix. Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar ( | ). For example, if an object grants view permission to unknown and known users, and modify permission to project members, the resulting permission literal would be: V knora-admin:UnknownUser,knora-admin:KnownUser|M knora-admin:ProjectMember","title":"Permissions"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#consistency-checking","text":"Knora tries to enforce repository consistency by checking constraints that are specified in the Knora base ontology and in user-created ontologies. Three types of consistency rules are enforced: Cardinalities in OWL class definitions must be satisfied. Constraints on the types of the subjects and objects of OWL object properties must be satisfied. A datatype property may not have an empty string as an object. The implementation of consistency checking is partly triplestore-dependent; Knora may be able to provide stricter checks with some triplestores than with others.","title":"Consistency Checking"},{"location":"02-knora-ontologies/knora-base/#owl-cardinalities","text":"As noted in Resources , each subclass of Resource must use OWL cardinality restrictions to specify the properties it can have. More specifically, a resource is allowed to have a property that is a subproperty of kb:hasValue or kb:hasLinkTo only if the resource's class has some cardinality for that property. Similarly, a value is allowed to have a subproperty of kb:valueHas only if the value's class has some cardinality for that property. Knora supports, and attempts to enforce, the following cardinality constraints: owl:cardinality 1 : A resource of this class must have exactly one instance of the specified property. owl:minCardinality 1 : A resource of this class must have at least one instance of the specified property. owl:maxCardinality 1 : A resource of this class may have zero or one instance of the specified property. owl:minCardinality 0 : A resource of this class may have zero or more instances of the specified property. Knora requires cardinalities to be defined using blank nodes, as in the following example from knora-base : :Representation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Resource , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] . :StillImageRepresentation rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Representation , [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasStillImageFileValue ; owl:minCardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] . The cardinality of a link property must be the same as the cardinality of the corresponding link value property. Each owl:Restriction may have the predicate salsah-gui:guiOrder to indicate the order in which properties should be displayed in a GUI (see The SALSAH GUI Ontology ). A resource class inherits cardinalities from its superclasses. This follows from the rules of RDFS inference. Also, in Knora, cardinalities in the subclass can override cardinalities that would otherwise be inherited from the superclass. Specifically, if a superclass has a cardinality on a property P, and a subclass has a cardinality on a subproperty of P, the subclass's cardinality overrides the superclass's cardinality. In the example above, hasStillImageFileValue is a subproperty of hasFileValue . Therefore, the cardinality on hasStillImageFileValue overrides (i.e. replaces) the one on hasFileValue . Note that, unlike cardinalities, predicates of properties are not inherited. If :foo rdfs:subPropertyOf :bar , this does not mean that :foo inherits anything from :bar . Any predicates of :foo that are also needed by :bar must be defined explicitly on :bar . This design decision was made because property predicate inheritance is not provided by RDFS inference, and would make it more difficult to check the correctness of ontologies, while providing little practical benefit.

Every subproperty of kb:hasValue or a kb:hasLinkTo (i.e. every property of a resource that points to a kb:Value or to another resource) is required to have this constraint, because Knora relies on it to know what type of object to expect for the property.

The actual data is submitted as JSON (request and response format). The various HTTP methods are applied according to the widespread practice of RESTful APIs: GET for reading, POST for adding, PUT for changing resources and values, and DELETE to delete resources or values (see Using HTTP Methods for RESTful Services ). Knora IRIs in the Admin API Every resource that is created or hosted by Knora is identified by a unique ID called an Internationalized Resource Identifier ( IRI ). The IRI is required for every API operation to identify the resource in question. A Knora IRI has itself the format of a URL. For some API operations, the IRI has to be URL-encoded (HTTP GET requests). Unlike the Knora API v2, the admin API uses internal IRIs, i.e. the actual IRIs that are stored in the triplestore (see Knora IRIs ). Admin Path Segment Every request to Admin API includes admin as a path segment, e.g. http://host/admin/users/iri/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fusers%2Froot . Admin API Response Format If an API request is handled successfully, Knora responds with a 200 HTTP status code. The actual answer from Knora (the representation of the requested resource or information about the executed API operation) is sent in the HTTP body, encoded as JSON. Placeholder host in sample URLs Please note that all the sample URLs used in this documentation contain host as a placeholder. The placeholder host has to be replaced by the actual hostname (and port) of the server the Knora instance is running on. Authentication For all API operations that target at changing resources or values, the client has to provide credentials (username and password) so that the API server can authenticate the user making the request. Credentials can be sent as a part of the HTTP header or as parts of the URL (see Authentication in Knora ). OpenAPI/Swagger The Admin API uses OpenAPI for documentation purposes. To try it out, run webapi and open http://host/api-docs/swagger.json in http://petstore.swagger.io . Alternatively, the documentation can be looked at by using ReDoc , which is provided in knora/docs/redoc/index.html and is published under https://docs.knora.org/api-admin/index.html .

The example below shows the request body to create a new default object access permission with a custom IRI defined for a resource class of a specific project: { \"id\": \"http://rdfh.ch/permissions/00FF/DOAP-with-customIri\", \"forGroup\":null, \"forProject\":\"http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF\", \"forProperty\":null, \"forResourceClass\":\"http://www.knora.org/ontology/00FF/images#bild\", \"hasPermissions\":[{\"additionalInformation\":\"http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#ProjectMember\",\"name\":\"D\",\"permissionCode\":7}] } The response contains the newly created permission and its IRI, as: { \"default_object_access_permission\": { \"forGroup\": null, \"forProject\": \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF\", \"forProperty\": null, \"forResourceClass\": \"http://www.knora.org/ontology/00FF/images#bild\", \"hasPermissions\": [ { \"additionalInformation\": \"http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#ProjectMember\", \"name\": \"D\", \"permissionCode\": 7 } ], \"iri\": \"http://rdfh.ch/permissions/00FF/DOAP-with-customIri\" } }","title":"Creating New Permissions:"},{"location":"03-apis/api-admin/projects/","text":"Projects Endpoint Endpoint Overview Project Operations: GET: /admin/projects : return all projects POST: /admin/projects : create a new project GET: /admin/projects/[iri | shortname | shortcode]/<identifier> : returns a single project identified either through iri, shortname, or shortcode PUT: /admin/projects/iri/<identifier> : update a project identified by iri DELETE: /admin/projects/iri/<identifier> : update project status to false GET: /admin/projects/iri/<identifier>/AllData : returns a TriG file containing the project's data Project Member Operations: GET: /admin/projects/[iri | shortname | shortcode]/<identifier>/members : returns all members part of a project identified through iri, shortname or shortcode Project Admin Member Operations: GET: /admin/projects/[iri | shortname | shortcode]/<identifier>/admin-members : returns all admin members part of a project identified through iri, shortname or shortcode Project Keyword Operations: GET: /admin/projects/Keywords : returns all unique keywords for all projects as a list GET: /admin/projects/iri/<identifier>/Keywords : returns all keywords for a single project Project Restricted View Settings Operations: GET: /admin/projects/iri/<identifier>/RestrictedViewSettings : returns the project's restricted view settings Project Operations Create a new project: Required permission: SystemAdmin Required information: shortname (unique; used for named graphs), status, selfjoin Optional information: longname, description, keywords, logo Returns information about the newly created project Remark: There are two distinct use cases / payload combination: (1) change ontology and data graph: ontologygraph, datagraph, (2) basic project information: shortname, longname, description, keywords, logo, institution, status, selfjoin TypeScript Docs: projectFormats - CreateProjectApiRequestV1 POST: /admin/projects/ BODY: { \"shortname\": \"newproject\", \"longname\": \"project longname\", \"description\": \"project description\", \"keywords\": \"keywords\", \"logo\": \"/fu/bar/baz.jpg\", \"status\": true, \"selfjoin\": false } Additionally, each project can have an optional custom IRI (of Knora IRI form) specified by the id in the request body as below: { \"id\": \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/3333\", \"shortname\": \"newprojectWithIri\", \"shortcode\": \"3333\", \"longname\": \"new project with a custom IRI\", \"description\": [{\"value\": \"a project created with a custom IRI\", \"language\": \"en\"}], \"keywords\": [\"projectWithIRI\"], \"logo\": \"/fu/bar/baz.jpg\", \"status\": true, \"selfjoin\": false } Update project information: Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin Changeable information: shortname, longname, description, keywords, logo, status, selfjoin TypeScript Docs: projectFormats - ChangeProjectApiRequestV1 PUT: /admin/projects/iri/<projectIri> BODY: { \"shortname\": \"newproject\", \"longname\": \"project longname\", \"description\": \"project description\", \"keywords\": \"keywords\", \"logo\": \"/fu/bar/baz.jpg\", \"status\": true, \"selfjoin\": false } Delete project (update project status): Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin Remark: The same as updating a project and changing status to false .

The request has to be sent to the Knora server using the resources path segment: HTTP POST to http://host/v1/resources Unlike in the case of GET requests, the request body consists of JSON describing the resource to be created. Creating resources requires authentication since only known users may add resources. Adding Resources Without Image Files The format of the JSON used to create a resource without an image file is described in the TypeScript interface createResourceWithoutRepresentationRequest in module createResourceFormats . It requires the IRI of the resource class the new resource belongs to, a label describing the new resource, the IRI of the project the new resource belongs to, and the properties to be assigned to the new resource. The request header's content type has to be set to application/json . Adding Resources with Image Files The first step is to upload an image file to Sipi, using a multipart/form-data request, where sipihost represents the host and port on which Sipi is running: HTTP POST to http://sipihost/upload?token=TOKEN The TOKEN is the sid returned by Knora in response to the client's login request (see Authentication ). The request must contain a body part providing the file as well as a parameter filename , providing the file's original filename, which both Knora and Sipi will store; these filenames can be descriptive and need not be unique. Sipi will then convert the uploaded image file to JPEG 2000 format and store it in a temporary location. If this is successful, it will return a JSON response that looks something like this: { \"uploadedFiles\": [{ \"originalFilename\": \"manuscript-1234-page-1.tiff\", \"internalFilename\": \"3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2\", \"temporaryBaseIIIFUrl\": \"http://sipihost/tmp\" }] } This provides: the originalFilename , which we submitted when uploading the file the unique internalFilename that Sipi has randomly generated for the file the temporaryBaseIIIFUrl , which we can use to construct a IIIF URL for previewing the file The client may now wish to get a thumbnail of the uploaded image, to allow the user to confirm that the correct files have been uploaded. This can be done by adding the filename and IIIF parameters to temporaryBaseIIIFUrl . For example, to get a JPG thumbnail image whose width and height are at most 128 pixels wide, you would request http://sipihost/tmp/3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2/full/!128,128/0/default.jpg . The request to Knora works similarly to Adding Resources Without Image Files , with the addition of file , whose value is the internalFilename that Sipi returned. See the TypeScript interface createResourceWithRepresentationRequest in module createResourceFormats for details. The request header's content type must be set to application/json . Response to a Resource Creation When a resource has been successfully created, Knora sends back a JSON containing the new resource's IRI ( res_id ) and its properties. The resource IRI identifies the resource and can be used to perform future Knora API V1 operations. The JSON format of the response is described in the TypeScript interface createResourceResponse in module createResourceFormats . Changing a Resource's Label A resource's label can be changed by making a PUT request to the path segments resources/label . The resource's IRI has to be provided in the URL (as its last segment). The new label has to submitted as JSON in the HTTP request's body. HTTP PUT to http://host/v1/resources/label/resourceIRI The JSON format of the request is described in the TypeScript interface changeResourceLabelRequest in module createResourceFormats . The response is described in the TypeScript interface changeResourceLabelResponse in module createResourceFormats . Bulk Import If you have a large amount of data to import into Knora, it can be more convenient to use the bulk import feature than to create resources one by one. In a bulk import operation, you submit an XML document to Knora, describing multiple resources to be created. This is especially useful if the resources to be created have links to one another. Knora checks the entire request for consistency as as a whole, and performs the update in a single database transaction. Only system or project administrators may use the bulk import. The procedure for using this feature is as follows (see the example below ). Make an HTTP GET request to Knora to get XML schemas describing the XML to be provided for the import. If you are importing image files, upload files to Sipi . Generate an XML import document representing the data to be imported, following the Knora import schemas that were generated in step 1. You will probably want to write a script to do this. Knora is not involved in this step. If you are also importing image files, this XML document needs to contain the filenames that Sipi returned for the files you uploaded in step 2. Validate your XML import document , using an XML schema validator such as Apache Xerces or Saxon , or an XML development environment such as Oxygen . This will help ensure that the data you submit to Knora is correct. Knora is not involved in this step. Submit the XML import document to Knora . In this procedure, the person responsible for generating the XML import data need not be familiar with RDF or with the ontologies involved. When Knora receives an XML import, it validates it first using the relevant XML schemas, and then using the same internal checks that it performs when creating any resource. The details of the XML import format are illustrated in the following examples. Bulk Import Example Suppose we have a project with existing data (but no image files), which we want to import into Knora. We have created an ontology called http://www.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio for the project, and this ontology also uses definitions from another ontology, called http://www.knora.org/ontology/0801/beol . 1. Get XML Schemas To get XML schemas for an import, we use the following route, specifying the (URL-encoded) IRI of our project's main ontology (in this case http://www.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio ): HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources/xmlimportschemas/ontologyIRI In our example, the URL could be: http://localhost:3333/v1/resources/xmlimportschemas/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2F0801%2Fbiblio This returns a Zip archive called p0801-biblio-xml-schemas.zip , containing three files: p0801-biblio.xsd : The schema for our main ontology. p0801-beol.xsd : A schema for another ontology that our main ontology depends on. knoraXmlImport.xsd : The standard Knora XML import schema, used by all XML imports. 2. Upload Files to Sipi See Upload Files to Sipi in the Knora API v2 documentation. 3. Generate XML Import Document We now convert our existing data to XML, probably by writing a custom script. The resulting XML import document could look like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <knoraXmlImport:resources xmlns=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1#\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1# p0801-biblio.xsd\" xmlns:p0801-biblio=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1#\" xmlns:p0801-beol=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/beol/xml-import/v1#\" xmlns:knoraXmlImport=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knoraXmlImport/v1#\"> <p0801-beol:person id=\"abel\"> <knoraXmlImport:label>Niels Henrik Abel</knoraXmlImport:label> <p0801-beol:hasFamilyName knoraType=\"richtext_value\">Abel</p0801-beol:hasFamilyName> <p0801-beol:hasGivenName knoraType=\"richtext_value\">Niels Henrik</p0801-beol:hasGivenName> <p0801-beol:personHasTitle knoraType=\"richtext_value\" lang=\"en\">Sir</p0801-beol:personHasTitle> </p0801-beol:person> <p0801-beol:person id=\"holmes\"> <knoraXmlImport:label>Sherlock Holmes</knoraXmlImport:label> <p0801-beol:hasFamilyName knoraType=\"richtext_value\">Holmes</p0801-beol:hasFamilyName> <p0801-beol:hasGivenName knoraType=\"richtext_value\">Sherlock</p0801-beol:hasGivenName> </p0801-beol:person> <p0801-biblio:Journal id=\"math_intelligencer\"> <knoraXmlImport:label>Math Intelligencer</knoraXmlImport:label> <p0801-biblio:hasName knoraType=\"richtext_value\">Math Intelligencer</p0801-biblio:hasName> </p0801-biblio:Journal> <p0801-biblio:JournalArticle id=\"strings_in_the_16th_and_17th_centuries\" creationDate=\"2019-01-09T15:45:54Z\"> <knoraXmlImport:label>Strings in the 16th and 17th Centuries</knoraXmlImport:label> <p0801-biblio:p0801-beol__comment knoraType=\"richtext_value\" mapping_id=\"http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping\"> <text xmlns=\"\">The most <strong>interesting</strong> article in <a class=\"salsah-link\" href=\"ref:math_intelligencer\">Math Intelligencer</a>.</text> </p0801-biblio:p0801-beol__comment> <p0801-biblio:endPage knoraType=\"richtext_value\">73</p0801-biblio:endPage> <p0801-biblio:isPartOfJournal> <p0801-biblio:Journal knoraType=\"link_value\" target=\"math_intelligencer\" linkType=\"ref\"/> </p0801-biblio:isPartOfJournal> <p0801-biblio:journalVolume knoraType=\"richtext_value\">27</p0801-biblio:journalVolume> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasAuthor> <p0801-beol:person knoraType=\"link_value\" linkType=\"ref\" target=\"abel\"/> </p0801-biblio:publicationHasAuthor> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasAuthor> <p0801-beol:person knoraType=\"link_value\" linkType=\"ref\" target=\"holmes\"/> </p0801-biblio:publicationHasAuthor> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasDate knoraType=\"date_value\">GREGORIAN:1976</p0801-biblio:publicationHasDate> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasTitle knoraType=\"richtext_value\" lang=\"en\">Strings in the 16th and 17th Centuries</p0801-biblio:publicationHasTitle> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasTitle knoraType=\"richtext_value\">An alternate title</p0801-biblio:publicationHasTitle> <p0801-biblio:startPage knoraType=\"richtext_value\">48</p0801-biblio:startPage> </p0801-biblio:JournalArticle> </knoraXmlImport:resources> This illustrates several aspects of XML imports: The root XML element must be knoraXmlImport:resources . There is an XML namespace corresponding each ontology used in the import. These namespaces can be found in the XML schema files returned by Knora. We have copied and pasted xmlns=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1#\" from the main XML schema, p0801-biblio.xsd . This enables the Knora API server to identify the main ontology we are using. We have used xsi:schemaLocation to indicate the main schema's namespace and filename. If we put our XML document in the same directory as the schemas, and we run an XML validator to check the XML, it should load the schemas. The child elements of knoraXmlImport:resources represent resources to be created. The order of these elements is unimportant. Each resource must have an ID, which must be an XML NCName , and must be unique within the file. These IDs are used only during the import, and will not be stored in the triplestore. Each resource can optionally have a creationDate attribute, which can be an xsd:dateTime or an xsd:dateTimeStamp . If creationDate is not supplied, the current time is used. The first child element of each resource must be a knoraXmlImport:label , which will be stored as the resource's rdfs:label . Optionally, the second child element of a resource can provide metadata about a file to be attached to the resource (see bulk-import-with-digital-representations). The remaining child elements of each resource represent its property values. These must be sorted in alphabetical order by property name. If a property has mutliple values, these are represented as multiple adjacent property elements. The type of each value must be specified using the attribute knoraType . A link to another resource described in the XML import is represented as a child element of a property element, with attributes knoraType=\"link_value\" and linkType=\"ref\" , and a target attribute containing the ID of the target resource. There is a specfic syntax for referring to properties from other ontologies. In the example, p0801-beol:comment is defined in the ontology http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/beol . In the XML, we refer to it as p0801-biblio:p0801-beol__comment . A text value can contain XML markup. If it does: The text value element must have the attribute mapping_id , specifying a mapping from XML to standoff markup (see XML-to-standoff-mapping). It is necessary to specify the appropriate XML namespace (in this case the null namespace, xmlns=\"\" ) for the XML markup in the text value. The XML markup in the text value will not be validated by the schema. In an XML tag that is mapped to a standoff link tag, the link target can refer either to the IRI of a resoruce that already exists in the triplestore, or to the ID of a resource described in the import. If a link points to a resource described in the import, the ID of the target resource must be prefixed with ref: . In the example above, using the standard mapping, the standoff link to math_intelligencer has the target ref:math_intelligencer . A text value can have a lang attribute, whose value is an ISO 639-1 code specifying the language of the text. 4. Validate XML Import Document You can use an XML schema validator such as Apache Xerces or Saxon , or an XML development environment such as Oxygen , to check that your XML import document is valid according to the schemas you got from Knora. For example, using Saxon: java -cp ./saxon9ee.jar com.saxonica.Validate -xsd:p0801-biblio.xsd -s:data.xml 5. Submit XML Import Document to Knora To create these resources in Knora, make an HTTP post request with the XML import document as the request body. The URL must specify the (URL-encoded) IRI of the project in which the resources should be created: HTTP POST to http://host/v1/resources/xmlimport/projectIRI For example, using curl : curl -v -u root@example.com:test --data @data.xml --header \"Content-Type: application/xml\" http://localhost:3333/v1/resources/xmlimport/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fprojects%2F0801 Bulk Import with Links to Existing Resources Having run the import in the previous example, we can import more data with links to the data that is now in the triplestore: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <knoraXmlImport:resources xmlns=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1#\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1# p0801-biblio.xsd\" xmlns:p0801-biblio=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1#\" xmlns:p0801-beol=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/beol/xml-import/v1#\" xmlns:knoraXmlImport=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knoraXmlImport/v1#\"> <p0801-biblio:JournalArticle id=\"strings_in_the_18th_century\"> <knoraXmlImport:label>Strings in the 18th Century</knoraXmlImport:label> <p0801-biblio:p0801-beol__comment knoraType=\"richtext_value\" mapping_id=\"http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping\"> <text xmlns=\"\">The most <strong>boring</strong> article in <a class=\"salsah-link\" href=\"http://rdfh.ch/biblio/QMDEHvBNQeOdw85Z2NSi9A\">Math Intelligencer</a>.</text> </p0801-biblio:p0801-beol__comment> <p0801-biblio:endPage knoraType=\"richtext_value\">76</p0801-biblio:endPage> <p0801-biblio:isPartOfJournal> <p0801-biblio:Journal knoraType=\"link_value\" linkType=\"iri\" target=\"http://rdfh.ch/biblio/QMDEHvBNQeOdw85Z2NSi9A\"/> </p0801-biblio:isPartOfJournal> <p0801-biblio:journalVolume knoraType=\"richtext_value\">27</p0801-biblio:journalVolume> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasAuthor> <p0801-beol:person knoraType=\"link_value\" linkType=\"iri\" target=\"http://rdfh.ch/biblio/c-xMB3qkRs232pWyjdUUvA\"/> </p0801-biblio:publicationHasAuthor> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasDate knoraType=\"date_value\">GREGORIAN:1977</p0801-biblio:publicationHasDate> <p0801-biblio:publicationHasTitle knoraType=\"richtext_value\">Strings in the 18th Century</p0801-biblio:publicationHasTitle> <p0801-biblio:startPage knoraType=\"richtext_value\">52</p0801-biblio:startPage> </p0801-biblio:JournalArticle> </knoraXmlImport:resources> Note that in the link elements referring to existing resources, the linkType attribute has the value iri , and the target attribute contains the IRI of the target resource. Bulk Import with Image Files To attach an image file to a resource, we must provide the element knoraXmlImport:file before the property elements. In this element, we must provide a filename attribute, containing the internalFilename that Sipi returned for the file in 2.

There is an XML namespace corresponding each ontology used in the import. These namespaces can be found in the XML schema files returned by Knora. We have copied and pasted xmlns=\"http://api.knora.org/ontology/0801/biblio/xml-import/v1#\" from the main XML schema, p0801-biblio.xsd . This enables the Knora API server to identify the main ontology we are using. We have used xsi:schemaLocation to indicate the main schema's namespace and filename. If we put our XML document in the same directory as the schemas, and we run an XML validator to check the XML, it should load the schemas. The child elements of knoraXmlImport:resources represent resources to be created. The order of these elements is unimportant. Each resource must have an ID, which must be an XML NCName , and must be unique within the file. These IDs are used only during the import, and will not be stored in the triplestore. Each resource can optionally have a creationDate attribute, which can be an xsd:dateTime or an xsd:dateTimeStamp . If creationDate is not supplied, the current time is used. The first child element of each resource must be a knoraXmlImport:label , which will be stored as the resource's rdfs:label . Optionally, the second child element of a resource can provide metadata about a file to be attached to the resource (see bulk-import-with-digital-representations). The remaining child elements of each resource represent its property values. These must be sorted in alphabetical order by property name. If a property has mutliple values, these are represented as multiple adjacent property elements. The type of each value must be specified using the attribute knoraType . A link to another resource described in the XML import is represented as a child element of a property element, with attributes knoraType=\"link_value\" and linkType=\"ref\" , and a target attribute containing the ID of the target resource. There is a specfic syntax for referring to properties from other ontologies. In the example, p0801-beol:comment is defined in the ontology http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/beol . In the XML, we refer to it as p0801-biblio:p0801-beol__comment . A text value can contain XML markup. If it does: The text value element must have the attribute mapping_id , specifying a mapping from XML to standoff markup (see XML-to-standoff-mapping). It is necessary to specify the appropriate XML namespace (in this case the null namespace, xmlns=\"\" ) for the XML markup in the text value. The XML markup in the text value will not be validated by the schema. In an XML tag that is mapped to a standoff link tag, the link target can refer either to the IRI of a resoruce that already exists in the triplestore, or to the ID of a resource described in the import. If a link points to a resource described in the import, the ID of the target resource must be prefixed with ref: . In the example above, using the standard mapping, the standoff link to math_intelligencer has the target ref:math_intelligencer . A text value can have a lang attribute, whose value is an ISO 639-1 code specifying the language of the text.","title":"3.

The actual data is submitted as JSON (request and response format). The diverse HTTP methods are applied according to the widespread practice of RESTful APIs: GET for reading, POST for adding, PUT for changing resources and values, and DELETE to delete resources or values (see Using HTTP Methods for RESTful Services ). Knora IRIs Every resource that is created or hosted by Knora is identified by a unique id, a so called Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI). The IRI is required for every API operation to identify the resource in question. A Knora IRI has itself the format of a URL. For some API operations, the IRI has to be URL-encoded (HTTP GET requests). Unlike Knora API v2, Knora API v1 uses internal IRIs, i.e. the actual IRIs that are stored in the triplestore (see Knora IRIs ). V1 Path Segment Every request to API V1 includes v1 as a path segment, e.g. http://host/v1/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a . Accordingly, requests to another version of the API will require another path segment. Knora API Response Format In case an API request could be handled successfully, Knora responds with a 200 HTTP status code. The actual answer from Knora (the representation of the requested resource or information about the executed API operation) is sent in the HTTP body, encoded as JSON (using UTF-8). In this JSON, an API specific status code is sent (member status ). The JSON formats are formally defined as TypeScript interfaces (located in salsah/src/typescript_interfaces ). Build the HTML documentation of these interfaces by executing make jsonformat (see docs/Readme.md for further instructions). Placeholder host in sample URLs Please note that all the sample URLs used in this documentation contain host as a placeholder. The placeholder host has to be replaced by the actual hostname (and port) of the server the Knora instance is running on. Authentication For all API operations that target at changing resources or values, the client has to provide credentials (username and password) so that the API server can authenticate the user making the request. When using the SALSAH web interface, after logging in a session is established (cookie based). When using the API with another client application, credentials can be sent as a part of the HTTP header or as parts of the URL (see Authentication in Knora ). Also when reading resources authentication my be needed as resources and their values may have restricted view permissions.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/introduction/#introduction-using-api-v1","text":"","title":"Introduction: Using API V1"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/introduction/#restful-api","text":"Knora API V1 is a RESTful API that allows for reading and adding of resources from and to Knora and changing their values using HTTP requests.

The request has to be sent to the Knora server using the resources path segment (depending on the type of request, this segment has to be exchanged, see below). Reading resources may require authentication since some resources may have restricted viewing permissions. Get the Representation of a Resource by its IRI Simple Request of a Resource (full Resource Request) A resource can be obtained by making a GET request to the API providing its IRI. Because a Knora IRI has the format of a URL, its IRI has to be URL encoded. In order to get the resource with the IRI http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a (an incunabula book contained in the test data), make a HTTP GET request to the resources route (path segment resources in the API call) and append the URL encoded IRI: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a More formalized, the URL looks like this: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources/resourceIRI As an answer, the client receives a JSON that represents the requested resource. It has the following members: status : The Knora status code, 0 if everything went well userdata : Data about the user that made the request resinfo : Data describing the requested resource and its class resdata : Short information about the resource and its class (including information about the given user's permissions on the resource) incoming : Resources pointing to the requested resource props : Properties of the requested resource. For a complete and more formalized description of a full resource request, look at the TypeScript interface resourceFullResponse in the module resourceResponseFormats . Provide Request Parameters To make a request more specific, the following parameters can be appended to the URL ( http://www.knora.org/resources/resourceIRI?param1=value1&param2=value2 ): reqtype=info|context|rights : Specifies the type of request. Setting the parameter's to value info returns short information about the requested resource (contains only resinfo and no properties, see TypeScript interface resourceInfoResponse in module resourceResponseFormats ). Setting the parameter's value to context returns context information ( resource_context ) about the requested resource: Either the dependent parts of a compound resource (e.g. pages of a book) or the parent resource of a dependent resource (e.g. the book a pages belongs to). By default, a context query does not return information about the requested resource itself, but only about its context (see TypeScript interface resourceContextResponse in module resourceResponseFormats ). See below how to get additional information about the resource. The parameter rights returns only the given user's permissions on the requested resource (see TypeScript interface resourceRightsResponse in module resourceResponseFormats ). resinfo=true : Can be used in combination with reqtype=context : If set, resinfo is added to the response representing information about the requested resource (complementary to its context), see TypeScript interface resourceContextResponse in module resourceResponseFormats . Obtain an HTML Representation of a Resource In order to get an HTML representation of a resource (not a JSON), the path segment resources.html can be used: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources.html/resourceIRI?reqtype=properties The request returns the properties of the requested resource as an HTML document. Get only the Properties belonging to a Resource In order to get only the properties of a resource without any other information, the path segment properties can be used: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/properties/resourceIRI The JSON contains just the member properties representing the requested resource's properties (see TypeScript interface resourcePropertiesResponse in module resourceResponseFormats ). Get Information about a Resource Class Get a Resource Class by its IRI In order to get information about a resource class, the path segment resourcetypes can be used. Append the IRI of the resource class to the URL (e.g. http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula#book ). HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resourcetypes/resourceClassIRI In the JSON, the information about the resource class and all the property types that it may have are returned. None of these are actual instances of a property, but only types (see TypeScript interface resourceTypeResponse in module resourceResponseFormats ). Get all the Property Types of a Resource Class or a Vocabulary To get a list of all the available property types, the path segment propertylists can be used. It can be restricted to a certain vocbulary using the parameter vocabulary or to a certain resource class using the parameter restype . # returns all the property types for incunabula:page HTTP GET to http://host/v1/propertylists?restype=resourceClassIRI # returns all the property types for the incunabula vocabulary HTTP GET to http://host/v1/propertylists?vocabulary=vocabularyIRI Both of these queries return a list of property types. The default value for the parameter vocabulary is 0 and means that the resource classes from all the available vocabularies are returned. See TypeScript interface propertyTypesInResourceClassResponse in module resourceResponseFormats . Get the Resource Classes of a Vocabulary Resource classes and property types are organized in (project specific) name spaces, so called vocabularies. In order to get all the resource classes defined for a specific vocabulary (e.g. incunabula ), the parameter vocabulary has to be used and assigned the vocabulary's IRI: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resourcetypes?vocabulary=vocabularyIRI This returns all the resource classes defined for the specified vocabulary and their property types. The default value for the parameter vocabulary is 0 and means that the resource classes from all the available vocabularies are returned. See TypeScript interface resourceTypesInVocabularyResponse in module resourceResponseFormats . Get all the Vocabularies To get a list of all available vocabularies, the path segment vocabularies can be used: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/vocabularies The response will list all the available vocabularies. See TypeScript interface vocabularyResponse in module resourceResponseFormats . Search for Resources Search for Resources by their Label This is a simplified way for searching for resources just by their label. Search by label automatically adds Lucene operators, search strings are expected not to contain any characters with a special meaning in Lucene Query Parser syntax . It is a simple string-based method: HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources?searchstr=searchValue Additionally, the following parameters can be appended to the URL (search value is Zeitgl\u00f6cklein ): restype_id=resourceClassIRI : This restricts the search to resources of the specified class (subclasses of that class will also match). -1 is the default value and means no restriction to a specific class. If a resource class IRI is specified, it has to be URL encoded (e.g. http://www.knora.org/v1/resources?searchstr=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&restype_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23book ). numprops=Integer : Specifies the number of properties returned for each resource that was found (sorted by GUI order), e.g. http://www.knora.org/v1/resources?searchstr=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&numprops=4 . limit=Integer : Limits the amount of results returned (e.g. http://www.knora.org/v1/resources?searchstr=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&limit=1 ). The response lists the resources that matched the search criteria (see TypeScript interface resourceLabelSearchResponse in module resourceResponseFormats ). Fulltext Search Knora offers a fulltext search that searches through all textual representations of values. The search terms have to be URL encoded. Fulltext search supports the Lucene Query Parser syntax . Note that Lucene's default operator is a logical OR when submitting several search terms. HTTP GET to http://host/v1/search/searchValue?searchtype=fulltext[&filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI] [&filter_by_project=projectIRI][&show_nrows=Integer]{[&start_at=Integer] The parameter searchtype is required and has to be set to fulltext . Additionally, these parameters can be set: filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI : restricts the search to resources of the specified resource class (subclasses of that class will also match). filter_by_project=projectIRI : restricts the search to resources of the specified project. show_nrows=Integer : Indicates how many reults should be presented on one page. If omitted, the default value 25 is used. start_at=Integer : Used to enable paging and go through all the results request by request. The response presents the retrieved resources (according to show_nrows and start_at ) and information about paging. If not all resources could be presented on one page ( nhits is greater than shown_nrows ), the next page can be requested (by increasing start_at by the number of show_nrows ). You can simply go through the elements of paging to request the single pages one by one. See TypeScript interface searchResponse in module searchResponseFormats . Extended Search for Resources HTTP GET to http://host/v1/search/?searchtype=extended [&filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI][&filter_by_project=projectIRI][&filter_by_owner=userIRI] (&property_id=propertyTypeIRI&compop=comparisonOperator&searchval=searchValue)+ [&show_nrows=Integer][&start_at=Integer] The parameter searchtype is required and has to be set to extended . An extended search requires at least one set of parameters consisting of: property_id=propertyTypeIRI : the property the resource has to have (subproperties of that property will also match). compop=comparisonOperator : the comparison operator to be used to match between the resource's property value and the search term. searchval=searchTerm : the search value to look for. You can also provide several of these sets to make your query more specific. The following table indicates the possible combinations of value types and comparison operators: Value Type Comparison Operator Date Value EQ, !EQ, GT, GT_EQ, LT, LT_EQ, EXISTS Integer Value EQ, !EQ, GT, GT_EQ, LT, LT_EQ, EXISTS Float Value EQ, !EQ, GT, GT_EQ, LT, LT_EQ, EXISTS Text Value MATCH_BOOLEAN, MATCH, EQ, !EQ, LIKE, !LIKE, EXISTS Geometry Value EXISTS Resource Pointer EQ, EXISTS Color Value EQ, EXISTS List Value EQ, EXISTS Boolean Value EQ, !EQ, EXISTS Explanation of the comparison operators: EQ : checks if a resource's value equals the search value. In case of a text value type, it checks for identity of the strings compared. In case of a date value type, equality is given if the dates overlap in any way. Since dates are internally always treated as periods, equality is given if a date value's period ends after or equals the start of the defined period and a date value's period starts before or equals the end of the defined period. !EQ : checks if a resource's value does not equal the search value. In case of a text value type, it checks if the compared strings are different. In case of a date value type, inequality is given if the dates do not overlap in any way, meaning that a date starts after the end of the defined period or ends before the beginning of the defined period (dates are internally always treated as periods, see above). GT : checks if a resource's value is greater than the search value. In case of a date value type, it assures that a period begins after the indicated period's end. GT_EQ : checks if a resource's value equals or is greater than the search value. In case of a date value type, it assures that the periods overlap in any way (see EQ ) or that the period starts after the indicated period's end (see GT ). LT : checks if a resource's value is lower than the search value. In case of a date value type, it assures that a period ends before the indicated period's start. LT_EQ : checks if a resource's value equals or is lower than the search value. In case of a date value type, it assures that the periods overlap in any way (see EQ ) or that the period ends before the indicated period's start (see LT ). EXISTS : checks if an instance of the indicated property type exists for a resource. Please always provide an empty search value when using EXISTS: \"searchval=\" . Otherwise, the query syntax rules would be violated. MATCH : checks if a resource's text value matches the search value. The behaviour depends on the used triplestore's full text index, see Lucene . LIKE : checks if the search value is contained in a resource's text value. !LIKE : checks if the search value is not contained in a resource's text value. MATCH_BOOLEAN : checks if a resource's text value matches the provided list of positive (exist) and negative (do not exist) terms. The list takes this form: ([+-]term\\s)+ . Additionally, these parameters can be set: filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI : restricts the search to resources of the specified resource class (subclasses of that class will also match). filter_by_project=projectIRI : restricts the search to resources of the specified project. filter_by_owner : restricts the search to resources owned by the specified user. show_nrows=Integer : Indicates how many reults should be presented on one page. If omitted, the default value 25 is used. start_at=Integer : Used to enable paging and go through all the results request by request. Some sample searches: http://localhost:3333/v1/search/?searchtype=extended&filter_by_restype=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23book&property_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23title&compop=!EQ&searchval=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein%20des%20Lebens%20und%20Leidens%20Christi : searches for books that have a title that does not equal \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\". http://www.knora.org/v1/search/?searchtype=extended&filter_by_restype=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23book&property_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23title&compop=MATCH&searchval=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&property_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23pubdate&compop=EQ&searchval=JULIAN:1490 : searches for resources of type incunabula:book whose titles match \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein\" and were published in the year 1490 (according to the Julian calendar). The response presents the retrieved resources (according to show_nrows and start_at ) and information about paging. If not all resources could be presented on one page ( nhits is greater than shown_nrows ), the next page can be requested (by increasing start_at by the number of show_nrows ). You can simply go through the elements of paging to request the single pages one by one. See the TypeScript interface searchResponse in module searchResponseFormats . Get a Graph of Resources The path segment graphdata returns a graph of resources that are reachable via links to or from an initial resource. HTTP GET to http://host/v1/graphdata/resourceIRI?depth=Integer The parameter depth specifies the maximum depth of the graph, and defaults to 4. If depth is 1, the operation will return only the initial resource and any resources that are directly linked to or from it. The graph includes any link that is a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo , except for links that are subproperties of knora-base:isPartOf . Specifically, if resource R1 has a link that is a subproperty of knora-base:isPartOf pointing to resource R2 , no link from R1 to R2 is included in the graph. The response represents the graph as a list of nodes (resources) and a list of edges (links). For details, see the TypeScript interface graphDataResponse in module graphDataResponseFormats . Get Hierarchical Lists The knora-base ontology allows for the definition of hierarchical lists. These can be queried by providing the IRI of the root node. Selections are hierarchical list that are just one level deep. Internally, they are represented as hierarchical lists. You can get a hierarchical by using the path segment hlists and appending the hierarchical list's IRI (URL encoded): HTTP GET to http://host/v1/hlists/rootNodeIRI The response shows all of the list nodes that are element of the requested hierarchical list as a tree structure. See TypeScript interface hierarchicalListResponse in module hierarchicalListResponseFormats . For each node, the full path leading to it from the top level can be requested by making a query providing the node's IRI and setting the param reqtype=node : HTTP GET to http://host/v1/hlists/nodeIri?reqtype=node The response presents the full path to the current node.

In order to create a TextValue with markup, the text has to be provided in XML format, along with the IRI of the mapping that will be used to convert the markup to standoff. However, a mapping is only needed if a TextValue with markup should be created. If a text has no markup, it is submitted as a mere sequence of characters. The two cases are described in the TypeScript interfaces simpletext and richtext in module basicMessageComponents . Knora offers a standard mapping with the IRI http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping . The standard mapping covers the HTML elements and attributes supported by the GUI's text editor, CKEditor . (Please note that the HTML has to be encoded in strict XML syntax. CKeditor offers the possibility to define filter rules. They should reflect the elements supported by the mapping; see jquery.htmleditor.js .) The standard mapping contains the following elements and attributes that are mapped to standoff classes and properties defined in the ontology: <text> \u2192 standoff:StandoffRootTag <p> \u2192 standoff:StandoffParagraphTag <em> \u2192 standoff:StandoffItalicTag <strong> \u2192 standoff:StandoffBoldTag <u> \u2192 standoff:StandoffUnderlineTag <sub> \u2192 standoff:StandoffSubscriptTag <sup> \u2192 standoff:StandoffSuperscriptTag <strike> \u2192 standoff:StandoffStrikeTag <a href=\"URL\"> \u2192 knora-base:StandoffUriTag <a class=\"salsah-link\" href=\"Knora IRI\"> \u2192 knora-base:StandoffLinkTag <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fragment\"> \u2192 knora-base:StandoffInternalReferenceTag <h1> to <h6> \u2192 standoff:StandoffHeader1Tag to standoff:StandoffHeader6Tag <ol> \u2192 standoff:StandoffOrderedListTag <ul> \u2192 standoff:StandoffUnrderedListTag <li> \u2192 standoff:StandoffListElementTag <tbody> \u2192 standoff:StandoffTableBodyTag <table> \u2192 standoff:StandoffTableTag <tr> \u2192 standoff:StandoffTableRowTag <td> \u2192 standoff:StandoffTableCellTag <br> \u2192 standoff:StandoffBrTag <hr> \u2192 standoff:StandoffLineTag <pre> \u2192 standoff:StandoffPreTag <cite> \u2192 standoff:StandoffCiteTag <blockquote> \u2192 standoff:StandoffBlockquoteTag <code> \u2192 standoff:StandoffCodeTag The HTML produced by CKEditor is wrapped in an XML doctype and a pair of root tags <text>...</text> and then sent to Knora. The XML sent to the GUI by Knora is unwrapped accordingly (see jquery.htmleditor.js ). Although the GUI supports HTML5, it is treated as if it was XHTML in strict XML notation. Maintenance The standard mapping definition can be found at test_data/test_route/texts/mappingForStandardHTML.xml . It was used to generate the default mapping, distributed as knora-ontologies/standoff-data.ttl and that is loaded at a Knora installation. It should be used to re-generate it, whenever we want to amend or extend it. Note: once the mapping has been generated, one has to rework the resources' UUID in order to maintain backward compatibility. Creating a custom Mapping The Knora standard mapping only supports a few HTML tags. In order to submit more complex XML markup to Knora, a custom mapping has to be created first. Basically, a mapping expresses the relations between XML elements and attributes and their corresponding standoff classes and properties. The relations expressed in a mapping are one-to-one relations, so the XML can be recreated from the data in RDF. However, since HTML offers a very limited set of elements, Knora mappings support the combination of element names and classes. In this way, the same element can be used several times in combination with another classname (please note that <a> without a class is a mere hyperlink whereas <a class=\"salsah-link\"> is an internal link/standoff link). With a mapping, a default XSL transformation may be provided to transform the XML to HTML before sending it back to the client. This is useful when the client is a web-browser expecting HTML (instead of XML). Basic Structure of a Mapping The mapping is written in XML itself (for a formal description, see webapi/src/resources/mappingXMLToStandoff.xsd ). It has the following structure (the indentation corresponds to the nesting in XML): <mapping> : the root element <defaultXSLTransformation> (optional) : the Iri of the default XSL transformation to be applied to the XML when reading it back from Knora. The XSL transformation is expected to produce HTML. If given, the Iri has to refer to a resource of type knora-base:XSLTransformation . <mappingElement> : an element of the mapping (at least one) <tag> : information about the XML element that is mapped to a standoff class <name> : name of the XML element <class> : value of the class attribute of the XML element, if any. If the element has no class attribute, the keyword noClass has to be used. <namespace> : the namespace the XML element belongs to, if any. If the element does not belong to a namespace, the keyword noNamespace has to be used. <separatesWords> : a Boolean value indicating whether this tag separates words in the text. Once an XML document is converted to RDF-standoff the markup is stripped from the text, possibly leading to continuous text that has been separated by tags before. For structural tags like paragraphs etc., <separatesWords> can be set to true in which case a special separator is inserted in the the text in the RDF representation. In this way, words stay separated and are represented in the fulltext index as such. <standoffClass> : information about the standoff class the XML element is mapped to <classIri> : Iri of the standoff class the XML element is mapped to <attributes> : XML attributes to be mapped to standoff properties (other than id or class ), if any <attribute> : an XML attribute to be mapped to a standoff property, may be repeated <attributeName> : the name of the XML attribute <namespace> : the namespace the attribute belongs to, if any. If the attribute does not belong to a namespace, the keyword noNamespace has to be used. <propertyIri> : the Iri of the standoff property the XML attribute is mapped to. <datatype> : the data type of the standoff class, if any. <type> : the Iri of the data type standoff class <attributeName> : the name of the attribute holding the typed value in the expected Knora standard format XML structure of a mapping: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <mapping> <defaultXSLTransformation>Iri of a knora-base:XSLTransformation</defaultXSLTransformation> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>XML element name</name> <class>XML class name or \"noClass\"</class> <namespace>XML namespace or \"noNamespace\"</namespace> <separatesWords>true or false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>standoff class Iri</classIri> <attributes> <attribute> <attributeName>XML attribute name</attributeName> <namespace>XML namespace or \"noNamespace\"</namespace> <propertyIri>standoff property Iri</propertyIri> </attribute> </attributes> <datatype> <type>standoff data type class</type> <attributeName>XML attribute with the typed value</attributeName> </datatype> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> <mappingElement> ... </mappingElement> </mapping> Please note that the absence of an XML namespace and/or a class have to be explicitly stated using the keywords noNamespace and noClass . (This is because we use XML Schema validation to ensure the one-to-one relations between XML elements and standoff classes. XML Schema validation's unique checks do not support optional values.) id and class Attributes The id and class attributes are supported by default and do not have to be included in the mapping like other attributes. The id attribute identifies an element and must be unique in the document. id is an optional attribute. The class attribute allows for the reuse of an element in the mapping, i.e. the same element can be combined with different class names and mapped to different standoff classes (mapping element <class> in <tag> ). Respecting Cardinalities A mapping from XML elements and attributes to standoff classes and standoff properties must respect the cardinalities defined in the ontology for those very standoff classes. If an XML element is mapped to a certain standoff class and this class requires a standoff property, an attribute must be defined for the XML element mapping to that very standoff property. Equally, all mappings for attributes of an XML element must have corresponding cardinalities for standoff properties defined for the standoff class the XML element maps to. However, since an XML attribute may occur once at maximum, it makes sense to make the corresponding standoff property required ( owl:cardinality of one) in the ontology or optional ( owl:maxCardinality of one), but not allowing it more than once. Standoff Data Types Knora allows the use of all its value types as standoff data types (defined in knora-base.ttl ): knora-base:StandoffLinkTag : Represents a reference to a Knora resource (the IRI of the target resource must be submitted in the data type attribute). knora-base:StandoffInternalReferenceTag : Represents an internal reference inside a document (the id of the target element inside the same document must be indicated in the data type attribute); see Internal References in an XML Document . knora-base:StandoffUriTag : Represents a reference to a URI (the URI of the target resource must be submitted in the data type attribute). knora-base:StandoffDateTag : Represents a date (a Knora date string must be submitted in the data type attribute, e.g. GREGORIAN:2017-01-27 ). knora-base:StandoffColorTag : Represents a color (a hexadecimal RGB color string must be submitted in the data type attribute, e.g. #0000FF ). knora-base:StandoffIntegerTag : Represents an integer (the integer must be submitted in the data type attribute). knora-base:StandoffDecimalTag : Represents a number with fractions (the decimal number must be submitted in the data type attribute, e.g. 1.1 ). knora-base:StandoffIntervalTag : Represents an interval (two decimal numbers separated with a comma must be submitted in the data type attribute, e.g. 1.1,2.2 ). knora-base:StandoffBooleanTag : Represents a Boolean value ( true or false must be submitted in the data type attribute). knora-base:StandoffTimeTag : Represents a timestamp value (an xsd:dateTimeStamp must be submitted in the data type attribute). The basic idea is that parts of a text can be marked up in a way that allows using Knora's built-in data types. In order to do so, the typed values have to be provided in a standardized way in an attribute that has to be defined in the mapping. Data type standoff classes are standoff classes with predefined properties (e.g., a knora-base:StandoffLinkTag has a knora-base:standoffTagHasLink and a knora-base:StandoffIntegerTag has a knora-base:valueHasInteger ). Please note the data type standoff classes can not be combined, i.e. a standoff class can only be the subclass of one data type standoff class. However, standoff data type classes can be subclassed and extended further by assigning properties to them (see below). The following simple mapping illustrates this principle: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <mapping> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>text</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#StandoffRootTag</classIri> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>mydate</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/anything#StandoffEventTag</classIri> <attributes> <attribute> <attributeName>description</attributeName> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <propertyIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/anything#standoffEventTagHasDescription</propertyIri> </attribute> </attributes> <datatype> <type>http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#StandoffDateTag</type> <attributeName>knoraDate</attributeName> </datatype> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> </mapping> <datatype> must hold the Iri of a standoff data type class (see list above). The <classIri> must be a subclass of this type or this type itself (the latter is probably not recommendable since semantics are missing: what is the meaning of the date?). In the example above, the standoff class is anything:StandoffEventTag which has the following definition in the ontology anything-onto.ttl : anything:StandoffEventTag rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:StandoffDateTag, [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :standoffEventTagHasDescription ; owl:cardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; rdfs:label \"Represents an event in a TextValue\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"\"\"Represents an event in a TextValue\"\"\"@en . anything:StandoffEventTag is a subclass of knora-base:StandoffDateTag and therefore has the data type date. It also requires the standoff property anything:standoffEventTagHasDescription which is defined as an attribute in the mapping. Once the mapping has been created, an XML like the following could be sent to Knora and converted to standoff: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <text> We had a party on <mydate description=\"new year\" knoraDate=\"GREGORIAN:2016-12-31\">New Year's Eve</mydate>. It was a lot of fun. </text> The attribute holds the date in the format of a Knora date string (the format is also documented in the typescript type alias dateString in module basicMessageComponents . There you will also find documentation about the other types like color etc.). Knora date strings have this format: GREGORIAN|JULIAN):YYYY[-MM[-DD]][:YYYY[-MM[-DD]]] . This allows for different formats as well as for imprecision and periods. Intervals are submitted as one attribute in the following format: interval-attribute=\"1.0,2.0\" (two decimal numbers separated with a comma). You will find a sample mapping with all the data types and a sample XML file in the the test data: test_data/test_route/texts/mappingForHTML.xml and test_data/test_route/texts/HTML.xml . Internal References in an XML Document Internal references inside an XML document can be represented using the data type standoff class knora-base:StandoffInternalReferenceTag or a subclass of it. This class has a standoff property that points to a standoff node representing the target XML element when converted to RDF. The following example shows the definition of a mapping element for an internal reference (for reasons of simplicity, only the mapping element for the element is question is depicted): <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>ref</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#StandoffInternalReferenceTag</classIri> <datatype> <type>http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#StandoffInternalReferenceTag</type> <attributeName>internalRef</attributeName> </datatype> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> Now, an internal reference to an element in the same document can be made that will be converted to a pointer in RDF: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <text> This is an <sample id=\"1\">element</sample> and here is a reference to <ref internalRef=\"#1\">it</ref>. </text> An internal reference in XML has to start with a # followed by the value of the id attribute of the element referred to. Predefined Standoff Classes and Properties The standoff ontology standoff-onto.ttl offers a set of predefined standoff classes that can be used in a custom mapping like the following: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <mapping> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>myDoc</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#StandoffRootTag</classIri> <attributes> <attribute> <attributeName>documentType</attributeName> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <propertyIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#standoffRootTagHasDocumentType</propertyIri> </attribute> </attributes> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>p</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>true</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#StandoffParagraphTag</classIri> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>i</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#StandoffItalicTag</classIri> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> </mapping> Predefined standoff classes may be used by various projects, each providing a custom mapping to be able to recreate the original XML from RDF. Predefined standoff classes may also be inherited and extended in project specific ontologies. The mapping above allows for an XML like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <myDoc documentType=\"letter\"> <p> This my text that is <i>very</i> interesting. </p> <p> And here it goes on. </p> </myDoc> Respecting Property Types When mapping XML attributes to standoff properties, attention has to be paid to the properties' object constraints. In the ontology, standoff property literals may have one of the following knora-base:objectDatatypeConstraint : xsd:string xsd:integer xsd:boolean xsd:decimal xsd:anyURI In XML, all attribute values are submitted as strings. However, these string representations need to be convertible to the types defined in the ontology. If they are not, the request will be rejected. It is recommended to enforce types on attributes by applying XML Schema validations (restrictions). Links (object property) to a knora-base:Resource can be represented using the data type standoff class knora-base:StandoffLinkTag , internal links using the data type standoff class knora-base:StandoffInternalReferenceTag . Validating a Mapping and sending it to Knora A mapping can be validated before sending it to Knora with the following XML Schema file: webapi/src/resources/mappingXMLToStandoff.xsd . Any mapping that does not conform to this XML Schema file will be rejected by Knora. The mapping has to be sent as a multipart request to the standoff route using the path segment mapping : HTTP POST http://host/v1/mapping The multipart request consists of two named parts: \"json\": { \"project_id\": \"projectIRI\", \"label\": \"my mapping\", \"mappingName\": \"MappingNameSegment\" } \"xml\": <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <mapping> ... </mapping> A successful response returns the Iri of the mapping. However, the Iri of a mapping is predictable: it consists of the project Iri followed by /mappings/ and the mappingName submitted in the JSON (if the name already exists, the request will be rejected). Once created, a mapping can be used to create TextValues in Knora. The formats are documented in the typescript interfaces addMappingRequest and addMappingResponse in module mappingFormats","title":"XML to Standoff Mapping"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/xml-to-standoff-mapping/#xml-to-standoff-mapping-in-api-v1","text":"","title":"XML to Standoff Mapping in API v1"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/xml-to-standoff-mapping/#the-knora-standard-mapping","text":"","title":"The Knora Standard Mapping"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/xml-to-standoff-mapping/#description","text":"A mapping allows for the conversion of XML to standoff representation in RDF and back.

In this way, the same element can be used several times in combination with another classname (please note that <a> without a class is a mere hyperlink whereas <a class=\"salsah-link\"> is an internal link/standoff link). With a mapping, a default XSL transformation may be provided to transform the XML to HTML before sending it back to the client. This is useful when the client is a web-browser expecting HTML (instead of XML).","title":"Creating a custom Mapping"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/xml-to-standoff-mapping/#basic-structure-of-a-mapping","text":"The mapping is written in XML itself (for a formal description, see webapi/src/resources/mappingXMLToStandoff.xsd ). It has the following structure (the indentation corresponds to the nesting in XML): <mapping> : the root element <defaultXSLTransformation> (optional) : the Iri of the default XSL transformation to be applied to the XML when reading it back from Knora. The XSL transformation is expected to produce HTML. If given, the Iri has to refer to a resource of type knora-base:XSLTransformation . <mappingElement> : an element of the mapping (at least one) <tag> : information about the XML element that is mapped to a standoff class <name> : name of the XML element <class> : value of the class attribute of the XML element, if any. If the element has no class attribute, the keyword noClass has to be used. <namespace> : the namespace the XML element belongs to, if any. If the element does not belong to a namespace, the keyword noNamespace has to be used. <separatesWords> : a Boolean value indicating whether this tag separates words in the text. Once an XML document is converted to RDF-standoff the markup is stripped from the text, possibly leading to continuous text that has been separated by tags before. For structural tags like paragraphs etc., <separatesWords> can be set to true in which case a special separator is inserted in the the text in the RDF representation. In this way, words stay separated and are represented in the fulltext index as such. <standoffClass> : information about the standoff class the XML element is mapped to <classIri> : Iri of the standoff class the XML element is mapped to <attributes> : XML attributes to be mapped to standoff properties (other than id or class ), if any <attribute> : an XML attribute to be mapped to a standoff property, may be repeated <attributeName> : the name of the XML attribute <namespace> : the namespace the attribute belongs to, if any.

Equally, all mappings for attributes of an XML element must have corresponding cardinalities for standoff properties defined for the standoff class the XML element maps to.

The basic idea is that parts of a text can be marked up in a way that allows using Knora's built-in data types. In order to do so, the typed values have to be provided in a standardized way in an attribute that has to be defined in the mapping. Data type standoff classes are standoff classes with predefined properties (e.g., a knora-base:StandoffLinkTag has a knora-base:standoffTagHasLink and a knora-base:StandoffIntegerTag has a knora-base:valueHasInteger ). Please note the data type standoff classes can not be combined, i.e. a standoff class can only be the subclass of one data type standoff class. However, standoff data type classes can be subclassed and extended further by assigning properties to them (see below). The following simple mapping illustrates this principle: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <mapping> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>text</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#StandoffRootTag</classIri> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> <mappingElement> <tag> <name>mydate</name> <class>noClass</class> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <separatesWords>false</separatesWords> </tag> <standoffClass> <classIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/anything#StandoffEventTag</classIri> <attributes> <attribute> <attributeName>description</attributeName> <namespace>noNamespace</namespace> <propertyIri>http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/anything#standoffEventTagHasDescription</propertyIri> </attribute> </attributes> <datatype> <type>http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#StandoffDateTag</type> <attributeName>knoraDate</attributeName> </datatype> </standoffClass> </mappingElement> </mapping> <datatype> must hold the Iri of a standoff data type class (see list above). The <classIri> must be a subclass of this type or this type itself (the latter is probably not recommendable since semantics are missing: what is the meaning of the date?). In the example above, the standoff class is anything:StandoffEventTag which has the following definition in the ontology anything-onto.ttl : anything:StandoffEventTag rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:StandoffDateTag, [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :standoffEventTagHasDescription ; owl:cardinality \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ; rdfs:label \"Represents an event in a TextValue\"@en ; rdfs:comment \"\"\"Represents an event in a TextValue\"\"\"@en . anything:StandoffEventTag is a subclass of knora-base:StandoffDateTag and therefore has the data type date. It also requires the standoff property anything:standoffEventTagHasDescription which is defined as an attribute in the mapping. Once the mapping has been created, an XML like the following could be sent to Knora and converted to standoff: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <text> We had a party on <mydate description=\"new year\" knoraDate=\"GREGORIAN:2016-12-31\">New Year's Eve</mydate>. It was a lot of fun. </text> The attribute holds the date in the format of a Knora date string (the format is also documented in the typescript type alias dateString in module basicMessageComponents . There you will also find documentation about the other types like color etc.). Knora date strings have this format: GREGORIAN|JULIAN):YYYY[-MM[-DD]][:YYYY[-MM[-DD]]] . This allows for different formats as well as for imprecision and periods. Intervals are submitted as one attribute in the following format: interval-attribute=\"1.0,2.0\" (two decimal numbers separated with a comma). You will find a sample mapping with all the data types and a sample XML file in the the test data: test_data/test_route/texts/mappingForHTML.xml and test_data/test_route/texts/HTML.xml .","title":"Standoff Data Types"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v1/xml-to-standoff-mapping/#internal-references-in-an-xml-document","text":"Internal references inside an XML document can be represented using the data type standoff class knora-base:StandoffInternalReferenceTag or a subclass of it.

The predicate knora-api:attachedToUser can be used to specify a creator other than the requesting user only if the requesting user is an administrator of the project or a system administrator. The specified creator must also have permission to create resources of that class in that project. In addition to the creation date, in the body of the request, it is possible to specify a custom IRI (of Knora IRI form) for a resource through the @id attribute which will then be assigned to the resource; otherwise the resource will get a unique random IRI. A custom resource IRI must be http://rdfh.ch/PROJECT_SHORTCODE/ (where PROJECT_SHORTCODE is the shortcode of the project that the resource belongs to), plus a custom ID string. Similarly, it is possible to assign a custom IRI to the values using their @id attributes; if not given, random IRIs will be assigned to the values. A custom value IRI must be the IRI of the containing resource, followed by a /values/ and a custom ID string. An optional custom UUID of a value can also be given by adding knora-api:valueHasUUID . Each custom UUID must be base64url-encoded , without padding. Each value of the new resource can also have a custom creation date specified by adding knora-api:creationDate (an xsd:dateTimeStamp ). For example: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-custom-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001\" }, \"anything:hasInteger\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-custom-thing/values/int-value-IRI\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:IntValue\", \"knora-api:intValueAsInt\" : 10, \"knora-api:valueHasUUID\" : \"IN4R19yYR0ygi3K2VEHpUQ\", \"knora-api:creationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2020-06-04T12:58:54.502951Z\" } }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"test thing with custom IRI\", \"knora-api:creationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2019-01-09T15:45:54.502951Z\" }, \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } The response is a JSON-LD document containing a preview of the resource. Modifying a Resource's Values See Editing Values . Modifying a Resource's Metadata You can modify the following metadata attached to a resource: label permissions last modification date To do this, use this route: HTTP PUT to http://host/v2/resources The request body is a JSON-LD object containing the following information about the resource: @id : the resource's IRI @type : the resource's class IRI knora-api:lastModificationDate : an xsd:dateTimeStamp representing the last modification date that is currently attached to the resource, if any. This is used to make sure that the resource has not been modified by someone else since you last read it. The submitted JSON-LD object must also contain one or more of the following predicates, representing the metadata you want to change: rdfs:label : a string knora-api:hasPermissions , in the format described in Permissions knora-api:newModificationDate : an xsd:dateTimeStamp . Here is an example: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"this is the new label\", \"knora-api:hasPermissions\" : \"CR knora-admin:Creator|M knora-admin:ProjectMember|V knora-admin:ProjectMember\", \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2017-11-20T15:55:17Z\" } \"knora-api:newModificationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2018-12-21T16:56:18Z\" }, \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } If you submit a knora-api:lastModificationDate that is different from the resource's actual last modification date, you will get an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error. If you submit a knora-api:newModificationDate that is earlier than the resource's knora-api:lastModificationDate , you will get an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error. A successful response is an HTTP 200 (OK) status containing a confirmation message. Deleting a Resource Knora does not normally delete resources; instead, it marks them as deleted, which means that they do not appear in normal query results. To mark a resource as deleted, use this route: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/resources/delete The request body is a JSON-LD object containing the following information about the resource: @id : the resource's IRI @type : the resource's class IRI knora-api:lastModificationDate : an xsd:dateTimeStamp representing the last modification date that is currently attached to the resource, if any. This is used to make sure that the resource has not been modified by someone else since you last read it. { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2019-02-05T17:05:35.776747Z\" }, \"knora-api:deleteComment\" : \"This resource was created by mistake.\", \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } The optional property knora-api:deleteComment specifies a comment to be attached to the resource, explaining why it has been marked as deleted. The optional property knora-api:deleteDate (an xsd:dateTimeStamp ) indicates when the resource was marked as deleted; if not given, the current time is used. The response is a JSON-LD document containing the predicate knora-api:result with a confirmation message. Links to Deleted Resources If resource A has a link to resource B , and resource B is later marked as deleted, A 's link will still exist. Knora API v2 will still return the link when A is queried, but without any information about B (except for B 's IRI). If A 's link is necessary to meet the requirements of a cardinality, marking B as deleted will not violate the cardinality. The reason for this design is that A and B might be in different projects, and each project must retain control of its resources and be able to mark them as deleted, even if they are used by another project. In future, Knora may be able to notify the owner of A in this case. Erasing a Resource from the Triplestore Normally, resources are not actually removed from the triplestore; they are only marked as deleted (see Deleting a Resource ). However, sometimes it is necessary to erase a resource from the triplestore. To do so, use this route: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/resources/erase The request body is the same as for Deleting a Resource , except that knora-api:deleteComment is not relevant and will be ignored. To do this, a user must be a system administrator or an administrator of the project containing the resource. The user's permissions on the resource are not otherwise checked. A resource cannot be erased if any other resource has a link to it. Any such links must first be changed or marked as deleted (see Updating a Value and Deleting a Value ). Then, when the resource is erased, the deleted link values that referred to it will also be erased. This operation cannot be undone (except by restoring the repository from a backup), so use it with care.","title":"Editing Resources"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/editing-resources/#editing-resources","text":"","title":"Editing Resources"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/editing-resources/#creating-a-resource","text":"To create a new resources, use this route: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/resources The body of the request is a JSON-LD document in the complex API schema , specifying the type, rdfs:label , and its Knora resource properties and their values.

If permissions are not given, configurable default permissions are used (see Default Object Access Permissions ). To create a resource, the user must have permission to create resources of that class in that project. The predicate knora-api:attachedToUser can be used to specify a creator other than the requesting user only if the requesting user is an administrator of the project or a system administrator. The specified creator must also have permission to create resources of that class in that project. In addition to the creation date, in the body of the request, it is possible to specify a custom IRI (of Knora IRI form) for a resource through the @id attribute which will then be assigned to the resource; otherwise the resource will get a unique random IRI. A custom resource IRI must be http://rdfh.ch/PROJECT_SHORTCODE/ (where PROJECT_SHORTCODE is the shortcode of the project that the resource belongs to), plus a custom ID string. Similarly, it is possible to assign a custom IRI to the values using their @id attributes; if not given, random IRIs will be assigned to the values. A custom value IRI must be the IRI of the containing resource, followed by a /values/ and a custom ID string. An optional custom UUID of a value can also be given by adding knora-api:valueHasUUID . Each custom UUID must be base64url-encoded , without padding. Each value of the new resource can also have a custom creation date specified by adding knora-api:creationDate (an xsd:dateTimeStamp ).

Creating a Link Between Resources To create a link, you must create a knora-api:LinkValue , which represents metadata about the link. The property that connects the resource to the LinkValue is a link value property, whose name is constructed by adding Value to the name of the link property (see Links Between Resources ). The triple representing the direct link between the resources is created automatically. For example, if the link property that should connect the resources is anything:hasOtherThing , we can create a link like this: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasOtherThingValue\" : { \"@type\" : \"knora-api:LinkValue\", \"knora-api:linkValueHasTargetIri\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/tPfZeNMvRVujCQqbIbvO0A\" } }, \"@context\" : { \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } As with ordinary values, permissions on links can be specified by adding knora-api:hasPermissions . The response is a JSON-LD document containing: @id : the IRI of the value that was created. @type : the value's type. knora-api:valueHasUUID , the value's UUID, which remains stable across value versions, unless the link is changed to point to a different resource, in which case it is considered a new link and gets a new UUID. Changing a link's metadata, without changing its target, creates a new version of the link value with the same UUID. Creating a Text Value Without Standoff Markup Use the predicate knora-api:valueAsString of knora-api:TextValue : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasText\" : { \"@type\" : \"knora-api:TextValue\", \"knora-api:valueAsString\" : \"This is a text without markup.\" }, \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } Creating a Text Value with Standoff Markup Currently, the only way to create a text value with standoff markup is to submit it in XML format using an XML-to-standoff mapping . For example, suppose we use the standard mapping, http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping . We can then make an XML document like this: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <text> This text links to another <a class=\"salsah-link\" href=\"http://rdfh.ch/0001/another-thing\">resource</a>. </text> This document can then be embedded in a JSON-LD request, using the predicate knora-api:textValueAsXml : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasText\" : { \"@type\" : \"knora-api:TextValue\", \"knora-api:textValueAsXml\" : \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\\n<text>\\n This text links to another <a class=\\\"salsah-link\\\" href=\\\"http://rdfh.ch/0001/another-thing\\\">resource</a>.\\n</text>\", \"knora-api:textValueHasMapping\" : { \"@id\": \"http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping\" } }, \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } Note that quotation marks and line breaks in the XML must be escaped, and that the IRI of the mapping must be provided. Creating File Values Knora supports the storage of certain types of data as files, using Sipi (see FileValue ). Knora API v2 currently supports using Sipi to store the following types of files: Images: JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, or PNG which are stored internally as JPEG2000 Documents: PDF Text files: XML or CSV Support for other types of files will be added in the future. The following sections describe the steps for creating a file value. Upload Files to Sipi The first step is to upload one or more files to Sipi, using a multipart/form-data request, where sipihost represents the host and port on which Sipi is running: HTTP POST to http://sipihost/upload?token=TOKEN The token parameter must provide the JSON Web Token that Knora returned when the client logged in. Each body part in the request must contain a parameter filename , providing the file's original filename, which both Knora and Sipi will store; these filenames can be descriptive and need not be unique. Sipi stores the file in a temporary location. If the file is an image, it is converted first to JPEG2000 format, and the converted file is stored. Sipi then returns a JSON response that looks something like this: { \"uploadedFiles\": [{ \"originalFilename\": \"manuscript-1234-page-1.tiff\", \"internalFilename\": \"3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2\", \"temporaryBaseIIIFUrl\": \"http://sipihost/tmp\" }, { \"originalFilename\": \"manuscript-1234-page-2.tiff\", \"internalFilename\": \"2RvJgguglpe-B45EOk0Gx8H.jp2\", \"temporaryBaseIIIFUrl\": \"http://sipihost/tmp\" }] } In this example, we uploaded two files to Sipi, so uploadedFiles is an array with two elements. For each file, we have: the originalFilename , which we submitted when uploading the file the unique internalFilename that Sipi has randomly generated for the file the temporaryBaseIIIFUrl , which we can use to construct a IIIF URL for previewing the file In the case of an image file, the client may now wish to get a thumbnail of each uploaded image, to allow the user to confirm that the correct files have been uploaded. This can be done by adding IIIF parameters to temporaryBaseIIIFUrl . For example, to get a JPG thumbnail image that is 150 pixels wide, you would add /full/150,/0/default.jpg . Submit A File Value to Knora A Knora Representation (i.e. a resource containing information about a file) must always have exactly one file value attached to it. (see Representations ). Therefore, a request to create a new file value must always be submitted as part of a request to create a new resource (see Creating a Resource ). You can also update a file value in an existing Representation ; see Updating a Value . Instead of providing the file's complete metadata to Knora, you just provide the unique internal filename generated by Sipi. Here is an example of a request to create a resource of class anything:ThingPicture , which is a subclass of knora-api:StillImageRepresentation and therefore has the property knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue : { \"@type\" : \"anything:ThingPicture\", \"knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue\" : { \"@type\" : \"knora-api:StillImageFileValue\", \"knora-api:fileValueHasFilename\" : \"3UIsXH9bP0j-BV0D4sN51Xz.jp2\" }, \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"test thing\", \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } Knora then gets the rest of the file's metadata from Sipi. If the client's request to Knora is valid, Knora saves the file value in the triplestore and instructs Sipi to move the file to permanent storage. Otherwise, the temporary file that was stored by Sipi is deleted. If you're submitting a PDF document, use the resource class knora-api:DocumentRepresentation , which has the property knora-api:hasDocumentFileValue , pointing to a knora-api:DocumentFileValue . For a text file, use knora-api:TextRepresentation , which has the property knora-api:hasTextFileValue , pointing to a knora-api:TextFileValue . Updating a Value To update a value, use this route: HTTP PUT to http://host/v2/values Updating a value means creating a new version of an existing value. The new version will have a different IRI. The request is the same as for creating a value, except that the @id of the current value version is given. For example, to update an integer value: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasInteger\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/vp96riPIRnmQcbMhgpv_Rg\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:IntValue\", \"knora-api:intValueAsInt\" : 5 }, \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } The value can be given a comment by using knora-api:valueHasComment . To change only the comment of a value, you can resubmit the existing value with the updated comment. Permissions can be specified by adding knora-api:hasPermissions . Otherwise, the new version has the same permissions as the previous one. To change the permissions on a value, the user must have change rights permission on the value. To update only the permissions on a value, submit it with the new permissions and with its @id and @type but without any other content, like this: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasInteger\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/vp96riPIRnmQcbMhgpv_Rg\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:IntValue\", \"knora-api:hasPermissions\" : \"CR knora-admin:Creator|V knora-admin:KnownUser\" }, \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } To update a link, the user must have modify permission on the containing resource as well as on the value. To update a value and give it a custom timestamp, add knora-api:valueCreationDate (an xsd:dateTimeStamp ). To update a value and give the new version a custom IRI, add knora-api:newValueVersionIri , like this: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasInteger\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/vp96riPIRnmQcbMhgpv_Rg\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:IntValue\", \"knora-api:intValueAsInt\" : 21, \"knora-api:newValueVersionIri\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/int-value-IRI\" } }, \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } A custom value IRI must be the IRI of the containing resource, followed by a /values/ and a custom ID string. The response is a JSON-LD document containing only @id and @type , returning the IRI and type of the new value version. If you submit an outdated value ID in a request to update a value, the response will be an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error. The response to a value update request contains: @id : the IRI of the value that was created. @type : the value's type. knora-api:valueHasUUID , the value's UUID, which remains stable across value versions, unless the value is a link value and is changed to point to a different resource, in which case it is considered a new link and gets a new UUID. Deleting a Value Knora does not normally delete values; instead, it marks them as deleted, which means that they do not appear in normal query results. To mark a value as deleted, use this route: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/values/delete The request must include the resource's ID and type, the property that points from the resource to the value, and the value's ID and type. For example: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasInteger\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/a-thing/values/vp96riPIRnmQcbMhgpv_Rg\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:IntValue\", \"knora-api:deleteComment\" : \"This value was created by mistake.\" }, \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } The optional property knora-api:deleteComment specifies a comment to be attached to the value, explaining why it has been marked as deleted The optional property knora-api:deleteDate (an xsd:dateTimeStamp ) specifies a custom timestamp indicating when the value was deleted. If not specified, the current time is used. The response is a JSON-LD document containing the predicate knora-api:result with a confirmation message.","title":"Editing Values"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/editing-values/#editing-values","text":"","title":"Editing Values"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/editing-values/#creating-a-value","text":"To create a value in an existing resource, use this route: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/values The body of the request is a JSON-LD document in the complex API schema , specifying the resource's IRI and type, the resource property, and the content of the value.

Version 1 was basically the result of the reimplementation of the existing API of the SALSAH prototype. Since the development of this prototype has a long history and the specification of API V1 was an evolving process, V1 has various inconsistencies and peculiarities. With V2, we would like to offer a format that is consistent and hence easier to use for a client. Please note that V2 is still in development. We do not yet recommend using it on productive systems. API v2 Path Segment Every request to API v2 includes v2 as a path segment, e.g. http://host/v2/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a . Accordingly, requests using any other version of the API will require another path segment. Response Formats All API v2 responses can be returned in JSON-LD , Turtle , or RDF/XML , using HTTP content negotiation . The client can request these formats using the following MIME types: Format MIME Type JSON-LD application/ld+json Turtle text/turtle RDF/XML application/rdf+xml JSON-LD Our preferred format for data exchange is JSON-LD . JSON-LD allows the Knora API server to provide responses that are relatively easy for automated processes to interpret, since their structure and semantics is explicitly defined. For example, each user-created Knora resource property is identified by an IRI, which can be dereferenced to get more information about it (e.g. its label in different languages). Moreover, each value has a type represented by an IRI. These are either standard RDF types (e.g. XSD datatypes) or more complex types whose IRIs can be dereferenced to get more information about their structure. At the same time, JSON-LD responses are relatively easy for software developers to work with, and are more concise and easier to read than the equivalent XML. Items in a response can have human-readable names, which can nevertheless be expanded to full IRIs. Also, while a format such as Turtle just provides a set of RDF triples, an equivalent JSON-LD response can explicitly provide data in a hierarchical structure, with objects nested inside other objects. Knora IRIs Resources and entities are identified by IRIs. The format of these IRIs is explained in Knora IRIs . API Schema Knora API v2 uses RDF data structures that are simpler than the ones actually stored in the triplestore, and more suitable for the development of client software. Thus we refer to the internal schema of data as it is stored in the triplestore, and to external schemas which are used to represent that data in API v2. Knora API v2 offers a complex schema and a simple one. The main difference is that the complex schema exposes the complexity of value objects, while the simple version does not. A client that needs to edit values must use the complex schema in order to obtain the IRI of each value. A client that reads but does not update data can use the simplified schema. The simple schema is mainly intended to facilitate interoperability with other RDF-based systems in the context of Linked Open Data. It is therefore designed to use the simplest possible datatypes and to require minimal knowledge of Knora. In either case, the client deals only with data whose structure and semantics are defined by external Knora API ontologies, which are distinct from the internal ontologies that are used to store date in the triplestore. The Knora API server automatically converts back and forth between these internal and external representations. This approach encapsulates the internals and adds a layer of abstraction to them. IRIs representing ontologies and ontology entities are different in different schemas; see Knora IRIs . Some API operations inherently require the client to accept responses in the complex schema. For example, if an ontology is requested using an IRI indicating the simple schema, the ontology will be returned in the simple schema (see Querying, Creating, and Updating Ontologies ). Other API operations can return data in either schema. In this case, the complex schema is used by default in the response, unless the request specifically asks for the simple schema. The client can specify the desired schema by using an HTTP header or a URL parameter: the HTTP header X-Knora-Accept-Schema the URL parameter schema Both the HTTP header and the URL parameter accept the values simple or complex .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/introduction/#introduction-using-api-v2","text":"Version 2 of the Knora API aims to make both the response and request formats more generic and consistent.

Project Short-Codes A project short-code is a hexadecimal number of at least four digits, assigned by the DaSCH to uniquely identify a Knora project regardless of where it is hosted. The IRIs of ontologies that are built into Knora do not contain shortcodes; these ontologies implicitly belong to the Knora system project. A user-created ontology IRI must always include its project shortcode. Project ID 0000 is reserved for shared ontologies (see Shared Ontologies ). The range of project IDs from 0001 to 00FF inclusive is reserved for local testing. Thus, the first useful project will be 0100 . In the beginning, Unil will use the IDs 0100 to 07FF , and Unibas 0800 to 08FF . IRIs for Ontologies and Ontology Entities Internal Ontology IRIs Knora makes a distinction between internal and external ontologies. Internal ontologies are used in the triplestore, while external ontologies are used in API v2. For each internal ontology, there is a corresponding external ontology. Some internal ontologies are built into Knora, while others are user-created. Knora automatically generates external ontologies based on user-created internal ontologies. Each internal ontology has an IRI, which is also the IRI of the named graph that contains the ontology in the triplestore. An internal ontology IRI has the form: http://www.knora.org/ontology/PROJECT_SHORTCODE/ONTOLOGY_NAME For example, the internal ontology IRI based on project code 0001 and ontology name example would be: http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/example An ontology name must be a valid XML NCName . The following names are reserved for built-in internal Knora ontologies: knora-base standoff salsah-gui Names starting with knora are reserved for future built-in Knora ontologies. A user-created ontology name may not start with the letter v followed by a digit, and may not contain these reserved words: knora ontology simple shared External Ontology IRIs Unlike internal ontology IRIs, external ontology IRIs are meant to be dereferenced as URLs. When an ontology IRI is dereferenced, the ontology itself can be served either in a machine-readable format or as human-readable documentation. The IRI of an external Knora ontology has the form: http://HOST[:PORT]/ontology/PROJECT_SHORTCODE/ONTOLOGY_NAME/API_VERSION For built-in and shared ontologies, the host is always api.knora.org . Otherwise, the hostname and port configured in application.conf under app.http.knora-api.host and app.http.knora-api.http-port are used (the port is omitted if it is 80). This means that when a built-in or shared external ontology IRI is dereferenced, the ontology can be served by a Knora API server running at api.knora.org . When the external IRI of a non-shared, project-specific ontology is dereferenced, the ontology can be served by Knora that hosts the project. During development and testing, this could be localhost . The name of an external ontology is the same as the name of the corresponding internal ontology, with one exception: the external form of knora-base is called knora-api . The API version identifier indicates not only the version of the API, but also an API 'schema'. The Knora API v2 is available in two schemas: A complex schema, which is suitable both for reading and for editing data. The complex schema represents values primarily as complex objects. Its version identifier is v2 . A simple schema, which is suitable for reading data but not for editing it. The simple schema facilitates interoperability between Knora ontologies and non-Knora ontologies, since it represents values primarily as literals. Its version identifier is simple/v2 . Other schemas could be added in the future for more specific use cases. When requesting an ontology, the client requests a particular schema. (This will also be true of most Knora API v2 requests: the client will be able to specify which schema the response should be provided in.) For example, suppose a Knora API server is running at knora.example.org and hosts an ontology whose internal IRI is http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/example . That ontology can then be requested using either of these IRIs: http://knora.example.org/ontology/0001/example/v2 (in the complex schema) http://knora.example.org/ontology/0001/example/simple/v2 (in the simple schema) While the internal example ontology refers to definitions in knora-base , the external example ontology that is served by the API refers instead to a knora-api ontology, whose IRI depends on the schema being used: http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2 (in the complex schema) http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2 (in the simple schema) Ontology Entity IRIs Knora ontologies use 'hash namespaces' (see URI Namespaces ). This means that the IRI of an ontology entity (a class or property definition) is constructed by adding a hash character ( # ) to the ontology IRI, followed by the name of the entity. In Knora, an entity name must be a valid XML NCName . Thus, if there is a class called ExampleThing in an ontology whose internal IRI is http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/example , that class has the following IRIs: http://www.knora.org/ontology/0001/example#ExampleThing (in the internal ontology) http://HOST[:PORT]/ontology/0001/example/v2#ExampleThing (in the API v2 complex schema) http://HOST[:PORT]/ontology/0001/example/simple/v2#ExampleThing (in the API v2 simple schema) Shared Ontology IRIs As explained in Shared Ontologies , a user-created ontology can be defined as shared, meaning that it can be used by multiple projects, and that its creators will not change it in ways that could affect other ontologies or data that are based on it. There is currently one project for shared ontologies: http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#DefaultSharedOntologiesProject Its project code is 0000 . Additional projects for shared ontologies may be supported in future. The internal and external IRIs of shared ontologies always use the hostname api.knora.org , and have an additional segment, shared , after ontology . The project code can be omitted, in which case the default shared ontology project, 0000 , is assumed. The sample shared ontology, example-box , has these IRIs: http://www.knora.org/ontology/shared/example-box (internal) http://api.knora.org/ontology/shared/example-box/v2 (external, complex schema) http://api.knora.org/ontology/shared/example-box/simple/v2 (external, simple schema) IRIs for Data Knora generates IRIs for data that it creates in the triplestore. Each generated data IRI contains one or more UUID identifiers to make it unique. To keep data IRIs relatively short, each UUID is base64url-encoded , without padding; thus each UUID is a 22-character string. Data IRIs are not currently intended to be dereferenced as URLs. Instead, each Knora resource has a separate permalink . A Knora value does not have a stable IRI throughout its version history. Each time a new version of a value is made, the new version gets a new IRI. Therefore, it would not make sense to publish Knora value IRIs. When designing ontologies for Knora projects, keep in mind that if you want something be directly citable, it needs to be a resource, not a value. The formats of generated data IRIs for different types of objects are as follows: Resource: http://rdfh.ch/PROJECT_SHORTCODE/RESOURCE_UUID .

Sample response: { \"@graph\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/00FF/images/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"The images demo ontology\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/yTerZGyxjZVqFMNNKXCDPF\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"The BEOL ontology\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0804/dokubib/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/0804\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"The dokubib ontology\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/salsah-gui/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#SystemProject\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"The salsah-gui ontology\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#SystemProject\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"The standoff ontology\" }, { \"@id\": \"http://knora.unil.ch/ontology/0001/anything/v2\", \"@type\": \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\": { \"@id\": \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001\" }, \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\": \"2017-12-19T15:23:42.166Z\", \"rdfs:label\": \"The anything ontology\" } ], \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"owl\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\" } } To get metadata about the ontologies that belong to one or more particular projects: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/ontologies/metadata/PROJECT_IRI[/PROJECT_IRI...] The project IRIs must be URL-encoded. Example response for the anything test project (project IRI http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001 ): { \"@id\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001\" }, \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\": \"2017-12-19T15:23:42.166Z\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"The anything ontology\", \"@context\" : { \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"owl\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\" } } Querying an Ontology An ontology can be queried either by using an API route directly or by simply dereferencing the ontology IRI. The API route is as follows: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/ontologies/allentities/ONTOLOGY_IRI The ontology IRI must be URL-encoded, and may be in either the complex or the simple schema. The response will be in the same schema. For example, if the server is running on 0.0.0.0:3333 , you can request the knora-api ontology in the complex schema as follows: HTTP GET to http://0.0.0.0:3333/v2/ontologies/allentities/http%3A%2F%2Fapi.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fknora-api%2Fv2 By default, this returns the ontology in JSON-LD; to request Turtle or RDF/XML, add an HTTP Accept header (see Response Formats ). If the client dereferences a project-specific ontology IRI as a URL, the Knora API server running on the hostname in the IRI will serve the ontology. For example, if the server is running on 0.0.0.0:3333 , the IRI http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/00FF/images/simple/v2 can be dereferenced to request the images sample ontology in the simple schema. If the client dereferences a built-in Knora ontology, such as http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2 , there must be a Knora API server running at api.knora.org that can serve the ontology. The DaSCH intends to run such as server. For testing, you can configure your local /etc/hosts file to resolve api.knora.org as localhost . Differences Between Internal and External Ontologies The external ontologies used by Knora API v2 are different to the internal ontologies that are actually stored in the triplestore (see API Schema ). In general, the external ontologies use simpler data structures, but they also provide additional information to make it easier for clients to use them. This is illustrated in the examples in the next sections. The internal predicates knora-base:subjectClassConstraint and knora-base:objectClassConstraint (see Constraints on the Types of Property Subjects and Objects ) are represented as knora-api:subjectType and knora-api:objectType in external ontologies. JSON-LD Representation of an Ontology in the Simple Schema The simple schema is suitable for client applications that need to read but not update data in Knora. For example, here is the response for the images sample ontology in the simple schema, http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/00FF/images/simple/v2 (simplified for clarity): { \"@id\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/00FF/images/simple/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"The images demo ontology\", \"@graph\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"images:bild\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Class\", \"knora-api:resourceIcon\" : \"bild.png\", \"rdfs:comment\" : \"An image of the demo image collection\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Image\", \"rdfs:subClassOf\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:StillImageRepresentation\" }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:creationDate\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:minCardinality\" : 0, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasIncomingLink\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:minCardinality\" : 0, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:minCardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasStillImageFile\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:maxCardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"rdfs:label\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:description\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:erfassungsdatum\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:maxCardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:urheber\" } } ] }, { \"@id\" : \"images:description\", \"@type\" : \"owl:DatatypeProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:bild\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"Description\", \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasValue\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" } ] }, { \"@id\" : \"images:erfassungsdatum\", \"@type\" : \"owl:DatatypeProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:Date\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:bild\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"Date of acquisition\", \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasValue\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/date\" } ] }, { \"@id\" : \"images:firstname\", \"@type\" : \"owl:DatatypeProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:person\" }, \"rdfs:comment\" : \"First name of a person\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"First name\", \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasValue\" } }, { \"@id\" : \"images:lastname\", \"@type\" : \"owl:DatatypeProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:person\" }, \"rdfs:comment\" : \"Last name of a person\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Name\", \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasValue\" } }, { \"@id\" : \"images:person\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Class\", \"knora-api:resourceIcon\" : \"person.png\", \"rdfs:comment\" : \"Person\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Person\", \"rdfs:subClassOf\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:Resource\" }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:creationDate\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:minCardinality\" : 0, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasIncomingLink\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:minCardinality\" : 0, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:maxCardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"rdfs:label\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:lastname\" } }, { \"@type\" : \"owl:Restriction\", \"owl:cardinality\" : 1, \"owl:onProperty\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:firstname\" } } ] }, { \"@id\" : \"images:urheber\", \"@type\" : \"owl:ObjectProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:person\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:bild\" }, \"rdfs:comment\" : \"An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.

Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Creator\", \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasLinkTo\" } } ], \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"images\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/00FF/images/simple/v2#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#\", \"owl\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\" } } The response format is an RDF graph. The top level object describes the ontology itself, providing its IRI (in the @id member) and its rdfs:label . The @graph member (see Named Graphs in the JSON-LD specification) contains an array of entities that belong to the ontology. In a class definition, cardinalities for properties of the class are represented as in OWL, using objects of type owl:Restriction . The supported cardinalities are the ones indicated in OWL Cardinalities . The class definitions include cardinalities that are directly defined on each class, as well as cardinalities inherited from base classes. For example, we can see cardinalities inherited from knora-api:Resource , such as knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo and http://schema.org/name (which represents rdfs:label ). In the simple schema, Knora value properties can be datatype properties. The knora-base:objectType of a Knora value property such as images:description is a literal datatype, in this case xsd:string . Moreover, images:description is a subproperty of the standard property dcterms:description , whose object can be a literal value. A client that understands rdfs:subPropertyOf , and is familiar with dcterms:description , can then work with images:description on the basis of its knowledge about dcterms:description . By default, values for rdfs:label and rdfs:comment are returned only in the user's preferred language, or in the system default language. To obtain these values in all available languages, add the URL parameter ?allLanguages=true . For example, with this parameter, the definition of images:description becomes: { \"@id\" : \"images:description\", \"@type\" : \"owl:DatatypeProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:bild\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : [ { \"@language\" : \"en\", \"@value\" : \"Description\" }, { \"@language\" : \"de\", \"@value\" : \"Beschreibung\" }, { \"@language\" : \"fr\", \"@value\" : \"Description\" }, { \"@language\" : \"it\", \"@value\" : \"Descrizione\" } ], \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasValue\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" } ] } To find out more about the knora-api entities used in the response, the client can request the knora-api ontology in the simple schema: http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2 . For example, images:erfassungsdatum has a knora-api:objectType of knora-api:Date , which is a subtype of xsd:string with a Knora-specific, human-readable format. In the knora-api simple ontology, there is a definition of this type: { \"@id\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"The knora-api ontology in the simple schema\", \"@graph\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:Date\", \"@type\" : \"rdfs:Datatype\", \"rdfs:comment\" : \"Represents a date as a period with different possible precisions.\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Date literal\", \"rdfs:subClassOf\" : { \"@type\" : \"rdfs:Datatype\", \"owl:onDatatype\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"owl:withRestrictions\" : { \"xsd:pattern\" : \"(GREGORIAN|JULIAN|ISLAMIC):\\\\d{1,4}(-\\\\d{1,2}(-\\\\d{1,2})?)?( BC| AD| BCE| CE)?(:\\\\d{1,4}(-\\\\d{1,2}(-\\\\d{1,2})?)?( BC| AD| BCE| CE)?)?\" } } } ], \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#\", \"owl\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\" } } JSON-LD Representation of an Ontology in the Complex Schema The complex schema is suitable for client applications that need to update data in Knora.

The knora-base:objectType of a Knora value property such as images:description is a Knora value class, in this case knora-api:TextValue . Similarly, images:erfassungsdatum has a knora-api:objectType of knora-api:DateValue , which has a more complex structure than the knora-api:Date datatype shown in the previous section. A client can find out more about these value classes by requesting the knora-api ontology in the complex schema, http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2 . Moreover, additional information is provided in the complex schema, to help clients that wish to create or update resources and values. A Knora resource class that can be instantiated is identified with the boolean properties knora-api:isResourceClass and knora-api:canBeInstantiated , to distinguish it from built-in abstract classes. Knora resource properties whose values can be edited by clients are identified with knora-api:isResourceProperty and knora-api:isEditable , to distinguish them from properties whose values are maintained automatically by Knora. Link value properties are shown along with link properties, because a client that updates links will need the IRIs of their link values. The predicate salsah-gui:guiOrder tells a GUI client in what order to display the properties of a class, and the predicates salsah-gui:guiElement and salsah-gui:guiAttribute specify how to configure a GUI element for editing the value of a property. For more information on the salsah-gui ontology, see The SALSAH GUI Ontology . Ontology Updates The ontology update API must ensure that the ontologies it creates are valid and consistent, and that existing data is not invalidated by a change to an ontology. To make this easier to enforce, the ontology update API allows only one entity to be created or modified at a time. It is not possible to submit an entire ontology all at once. Each update request is a JSON-LD document providing only the information that is relevant to the update. Moreover, the API enforces the following rules: An entity (i.e. a class or property) cannot be referred to until it has been created. An entity cannot be modified or deleted if it is used in data, except for changes to its rdfs:label or rdfs:comment . An entity cannot be modified if another entity refers to it, with one exception: a knora-api:subjectType or knora-api:objectType that refers to a class will not prevent the class's cardinalities from being modified. Because of these rules, some operations have to be done in a specific order: Properties have to be defined before they can be used in the cardinalities of a class, but a property's knora-api:subjectType cannot refer to a class that does not yet exist. The recommended approach is to first create a class with no cardinalities, then create the properties that it needs, then add cardinalities for those properties to the class. To delete a class along with its properties, the client must first remove the cardinalities from the class, then delete the property definitions, then delete the class definition. When changing an existing ontology, the client must always supply the ontology's knora-api:lastModificationDate , which is returned in the response to each update or when querying the ontology . If user A attempts to update an ontology, but user B has already updated it since the last time user A received the ontology's knora-api:lastModificationDate , user A's update will be rejected with an HTTP 409 Conflict error. This means that it is possible for two different users to work concurrently on the same ontology, but this is discouraged since it is likely to lead to confusion. An ontology can be created or updated only by a system administrator, or by a project administrator in the ontology's project. Ontology updates always use the complex schema. Creating a New Ontology An ontology is always created within a particular project. HTTP POST to http://host/v2/ontologies { \"knora-api:ontologyName\" : \"ONTOLOGY_NAME\", \"knora-api:attachedToProject\" : { \"@id\" : \"PROJECT_IRI\", }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"ONTOLOGY_NAME\", \"@context\" : { \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\" } } The ontology name must follow the rules given in Knora IRIs . The ontology metadata can have an optional comment given in the request body as: \"rdfs:comment\": \"some comment\", If the ontology is to be shared by multiple projects, it must be created in the default shared ontologies project, http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#DefaultSharedOntologiesProject , and the request must have this additional boolean property: \"knora-api:isShared\" : true See Shared Ontologies for details about shared ontologies. A successful response will be a JSON-LD document providing only the ontology's metadata, which includes the ontology's IRI. When the client makes further requests to create entities (classes and properties) in the ontology, it must construct entity IRIs by concatenating the ontology IRI, a # character, and the entity name. An entity name must be a valid XML NCName . Changing an Ontology's Metadata One can modify an ontology's metadata by updating its rdfs:label or rdfs:comment or both. The example below shows the request for changing the label of an ontology. HTTP PUT to http://host/v2/ontologies/metadata { \"@id\" : \"ONTOLOGY_IRI\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"NEW_ONTOLOGY_LABEL\", \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"ONTOLOGY_LAST_MODIFICATION_DATE\" }, \"@context\" : { \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\" } } Similarly, a user can change an ontology's existing comment or add one by specifying the new comment in the request body: { \"@id\" : \"ONTOLOGY_IRI\", \"rdfs:comment\" : \"NEW_ONTOLOGY_COMMENT\", \"knora-api:lastModificationDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"ONTOLOGY_LAST_MODIFICATION_DATE\" }, \"@context\" : { \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\" } } The request body can also contain a new label and a new comment for the ontology's metadata. A successful response will be a JSON-LD document providing only the ontology's metadata. Deleting an Ontology An ontology can be deleted only if it is not used in data. HTTP DELETE to http://host/v2/ontologies/ONTOLOGY_IRI?lastModificationDate=ONTOLOGY_LAST_MODIFICATION_DATE The ontology IRI and the ontology's last modification date must be URL-encoded. A successful response will be a JSON-LD document containing a confirmation message.

A successful response will be a JSON-LD document providing the new class definition (but not any of the other entities in the ontology). Creating a Class With Cardinalities This can work if the new class will have cardinalities for properties that have no knora-api:subjectType , or if the new class will be a subclass of their knora-api:subjectType .

If the property is a link property, the corresponding link value property (see Links Between Resources ) will automatically be created. The property definition must specify its knora-api:objectType . If the new property is a subproperty of knora-api:hasValue , its knora-api:objectType must be one of the built-in subclasses of knora-api:Value , which are defined in the knora-api ontology in the complex schema. If the new property is a subproperty of knora-base:hasLinkTo , its knora-api:objectType must be a subclass of knora-api:Resource . To improve consistency checking, it is recommended, but not required, to provide knora-api:subjectType , which must be a subclass of knora-api:Resource . The predicates salsah-gui:guiElement and salsah-gui:guiAttribute are optional. If provided, the object of guiElement must be one of the OWL named individuals defined in The SALSAH GUI Ontology . Some GUI elements take required or optional attributes, which are provided as objects of salsah-gui:guiAttribute ; see The SALSAH GUI Ontology for details.

The top level object describes the ontology itself, providing its IRI (in the @id member) and its rdfs:label . The @graph member (see Named Graphs in the JSON-LD specification) contains an array of entities that belong to the ontology. In a class definition, cardinalities for properties of the class are represented as in OWL, using objects of type owl:Restriction . The supported cardinalities are the ones indicated in OWL Cardinalities . The class definitions include cardinalities that are directly defined on each class, as well as cardinalities inherited from base classes. For example, we can see cardinalities inherited from knora-api:Resource , such as knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo and http://schema.org/name (which represents rdfs:label ). In the simple schema, Knora value properties can be datatype properties. The knora-base:objectType of a Knora value property such as images:description is a literal datatype, in this case xsd:string . Moreover, images:description is a subproperty of the standard property dcterms:description , whose object can be a literal value. A client that understands rdfs:subPropertyOf , and is familiar with dcterms:description , can then work with images:description on the basis of its knowledge about dcterms:description . By default, values for rdfs:label and rdfs:comment are returned only in the user's preferred language, or in the system default language. To obtain these values in all available languages, add the URL parameter ?allLanguages=true . For example, with this parameter, the definition of images:description becomes: { \"@id\" : \"images:description\", \"@type\" : \"owl:DatatypeProperty\", \"knora-api:objectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"knora-api:subjectType\" : { \"@id\" : \"images:bild\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : [ { \"@language\" : \"en\", \"@value\" : \"Description\" }, { \"@language\" : \"de\", \"@value\" : \"Beschreibung\" }, { \"@language\" : \"fr\", \"@value\" : \"Description\" }, { \"@language\" : \"it\", \"@value\" : \"Descrizione\" } ], \"rdfs:subPropertyOf\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:hasValue\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description\" } ] } To find out more about the knora-api entities used in the response, the client can request the knora-api ontology in the simple schema: http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2 . For example, images:erfassungsdatum has a knora-api:objectType of knora-api:Date , which is a subtype of xsd:string with a Knora-specific, human-readable format. In the knora-api simple ontology, there is a definition of this type: { \"@id\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2\", \"@type\" : \"owl:Ontology\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"The knora-api ontology in the simple schema\", \"@graph\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"knora-api:Date\", \"@type\" : \"rdfs:Datatype\", \"rdfs:comment\" : \"Represents a date as a period with different possible precisions.\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Date literal\", \"rdfs:subClassOf\" : { \"@type\" : \"rdfs:Datatype\", \"owl:onDatatype\" : { \"@id\" : \"xsd:string\" }, \"owl:withRestrictions\" : { \"xsd:pattern\" : \"(GREGORIAN|JULIAN|ISLAMIC):\\\\d{1,4}(-\\\\d{1,2}(-\\\\d{1,2})?)?( BC| AD| BCE| CE)?(:\\\\d{1,4}(-\\\\d{1,2}(-\\\\d{1,2})?)?( BC| AD| BCE| CE)?)?\" } } } ], \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#\", \"owl\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\" } }","title":"JSON-LD Representation of an Ontology in the Simple Schema"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/ontology-information/#json-ld-representation-of-an-ontology-in-the-complex-schema","text":"The complex schema is suitable for client applications that need to update data in Knora.

The knora-base:objectType of a Knora value property such as images:description is a Knora value class, in this case knora-api:TextValue . Similarly, images:erfassungsdatum has a knora-api:objectType of knora-api:DateValue , which has a more complex structure than the knora-api:Date datatype shown in the previous section. A client can find out more about these value classes by requesting the knora-api ontology in the complex schema, http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2 . Moreover, additional information is provided in the complex schema, to help clients that wish to create or update resources and values. A Knora resource class that can be instantiated is identified with the boolean properties knora-api:isResourceClass and knora-api:canBeInstantiated , to distinguish it from built-in abstract classes. Knora resource properties whose values can be edited by clients are identified with knora-api:isResourceProperty and knora-api:isEditable , to distinguish them from properties whose values are maintained automatically by Knora. Link value properties are shown along with link properties, because a client that updates links will need the IRIs of their link values. The predicate salsah-gui:guiOrder tells a GUI client in what order to display the properties of a class, and the predicates salsah-gui:guiElement and salsah-gui:guiAttribute specify how to configure a GUI element for editing the value of a property. For more information on the salsah-gui ontology, see The SALSAH GUI Ontology .","title":"JSON-LD Representation of an Ontology in the Complex Schema"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/ontology-information/#ontology-updates","text":"The ontology update API must ensure that the ontologies it creates are valid and consistent, and that existing data is not invalidated by a change to an ontology. To make this easier to enforce, the ontology update API allows only one entity to be created or modified at a time. It is not possible to submit an entire ontology all at once. Each update request is a JSON-LD document providing only the information that is relevant to the update. Moreover, the API enforces the following rules: An entity (i.e. a class or property) cannot be referred to until it has been created. An entity cannot be modified or deleted if it is used in data, except for changes to its rdfs:label or rdfs:comment . An entity cannot be modified if another entity refers to it, with one exception: a knora-api:subjectType or knora-api:objectType that refers to a class will not prevent the class's cardinalities from being modified. Because of these rules, some operations have to be done in a specific order: Properties have to be defined before they can be used in the cardinalities of a class, but a property's knora-api:subjectType cannot refer to a class that does not yet exist. The recommended approach is to first create a class with no cardinalities, then create the properties that it needs, then add cardinalities for those properties to the class. To delete a class along with its properties, the client must first remove the cardinalities from the class, then delete the property definitions, then delete the class definition. When changing an existing ontology, the client must always supply the ontology's knora-api:lastModificationDate , which is returned in the response to each update or when querying the ontology . If user A attempts to update an ontology, but user B has already updated it since the last time user A received the ontology's knora-api:lastModificationDate , user A's update will be rejected with an HTTP 409 Conflict error. This means that it is possible for two different users to work concurrently on the same ontology, but this is discouraged since it is likely to lead to confusion. An ontology can be created or updated only by a system administrator, or by a project administrator in the ontology's project.

Knora ARK URL Format For details, see Archival Resource Key (ARK) Identifiers . ARK URLs for Projects The format of a Knora project ARK URL is as follows: http://HOST/ark:/NAAN/VERSION/PROJECT NAAN is a Name Assigning Authority Number , VERSION is the version number of the Knora ARK URL format (currently always 1), and PROJECT is the project's short-code . For example, given a project with ID 0001 , and using the DaSCH's ARK resolver hostname and NAAN, the ARK URL for the project itself is: http://ark.dasch.swiss/ark:/72163/1/0001 This could redirect to a page describing the project. ARK URLs for Resources The format of a Knora resource ARK URL is as follows: http://HOST/ark:/NAAN/VERSION/PROJECT/RESOURCE_UUID[.TIMESTAMP] NAAN is a Name Assigning Authority Number , VERSION is the version number of the Knora ARK URL format (currently always 1), PROJECT is the project's short-code , and RESOURCE_UUID is the resource's UUID . For example, given the Knora resource IRI http://rdfh.ch/0001/0C-0L1kORryKzJAJxxRyRQ , and using the DaSCH's ARK resolver hostname and NAAN, the corresponding ARK URL without a timestamp is: http://ark.dasch.swiss/ark:/72163/1/0001/0C=0L1kORryKzJAJxxRyRQY The same ARK URL with an optional timestamp is: http://ark.dasch.swiss/ark:/72163/1/0001/0C=0L1kORryKzJAJxxRyRQY.20180604T085622513Z Without a timestamp, a Knora resource ARK URL refers to the latest version of the resource at the time when the URL is resolved. ARK URLs for Values The format of a Knora value ARK URL is as follows: http://HOST/ark:/NAAN/VERSION/PROJECT/RESOURCE_UUID/VALUE_UUID[.TIMESTAMP] NAAN is a Name Assigning Authority Number , VERSION is the version number of the Knora ARK URL format (currently always 1), PROJECT is the project's short-code , RESOURCE_UUID is the resource's UUID , and VALUE_UUID is the value's knora-api:valueHasUUID .

It also has the benefit of enabling clients to work with a simpler RDF data model than the one Knora actually uses to store data in the triplestore, and makes it possible to provide better error-checking. Rather than being processed directly by the triplestore, a Gravsearch query is interpreted by Knora, which enforces certain restrictions on the query, and implements paging and permission checking. The API server generates SPARQL based on the Gravsearch query submitted, queries the triplestore, filters the results according to the user's permissions, and returns each page of query results as a Knora API response. Thus, Gravsearch is a hybrid between a RESTful API and a SPARQL endpoint. A Gravsearch query conforms to a subset of the syntax of a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query, with some additional restrictions and functionality. In particular, the variable representing the top-level (or 'main') resource that will appear in each search result must be identified, statements must be included to specify the types of the entities being queried, OFFSET is used to control paging, and ORDER BY is used to sort the results. It is certainly possible to write Gravsearch queries by hand, but we expect that in general, they will be automatically generated by client software, e.g. by a client user interface. Submitting Gravsearch Queries The recommended way to submit a Gravsearch query is via HTTP POST: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/searchextended This works like query via POST directly in the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol : the query is sent unencoded as the HTTP request message body, in the UTF-8 charset. It is also possible to submit a Gravsearch query using HTTP GET. The entire query must be URL-encoded and included as the last element of the URL path: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/searchextended/QUERY The response to a Gravsearch query is an RDF graph, which can be requested in various formats (see Responses Describing Resources ). To request the number of results rather than the results themselves, you can do a count query: HTTP POST to http://host/v2/searchextended/count The response to a count query request is an object with one predicate, http://schema.org/numberOfItems , with an integer value. Gravsearch and API Schemas A Gravsearch query can be written in either of the two Knora API v2 schemas . The simple schema is easier to work with, and is sufficient if you don't need to query anything below the level of a Knora value. If your query needs to refer to standoff markup, you must use the complex schema. Each query must use a single schema, with one exception (see Date Comparisons ). Gravsearch query results can be requested in the simple or complex schema; see API Schema . All examples hereafter run with Knora started locally as documented in the section Getting Started with Knora . If you access another Knora-Stack, you can check the IRI of the ontology you are targeting by requesting the ontologies metadata . Using the Simple Schema To write a query in the simple schema, use the knora-api ontology in the simple schema, and use the simple schema for any other Knora ontologies the query refers to, e.g.: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> In the simple schema, Knora values are represented as literals, which can be used FILTER expressions (see Filtering on Values in the Simple Schema ). Using the Complex Schema To write a query in the complex schema, use the knora-api ontology in the complex schema, and use the complex schema for any other Knora ontologies the query refers to, e.g.: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/v2#> In the complex schema, Knora values are represented as objects belonging to subclasses of knora-api:Value , e.g. knora-api:TextValue , and have predicates of their own, which can be used in FILTER expressions (see Filtering on Values in the Complex Schema ). Main and Dependent Resources The main resource is the top-level resource in a search result. Other resources that are in some way connected to the main resource are referred to as dependent resources. If the client asks for a resource A relating to a resource B, then all matches for A will be presented as main resources and those for B as dependent resources. The main resource must be represented by a variable, marked with knora-api:isMainResource , as explained under CONSTRUCT Clause . Virtual incoming Links Depending on the ontology design, a resource A points to B or vice versa. For example, a page A is part of a book B using the property incunabula:partOf . If A is marked as the main resource, then B is nested as a dependent resource in its link value incunabula:partOfValue . But in case B is marked as the main resource, B does not have a link value pointing to A because in fact B is pointed to by A. Instead, B has a virtual property knora-api:hasIncomingLink containing A's link value: \"knora-api:hasIncomingLinkValue\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/A/values/xy\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:LinkValue\", \"knora-api:linkValueHasSource\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/A\", \"@type\" : \"incunabula:page\", \"incunabula:partOfValue\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/A/values/xy\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:LinkValue\", \"knora-api:linkValueHasTargetIri\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/B\" } } } }, Note that the virtually inserted link value inverts the relation by using knora-api:linkValueHasSource . The source of the link is A and its target B is only represented by an Iri ( knora-api:linkValueHasTargetIri ) since B is the main resource. Graph Patterns and Result Graphs The WHERE clause of a Gravsearch query specifies a graph pattern. Each query result will match this graph pattern, and will have the form of a graph whose starting point is a main resource. The query's graph pattern, and hence each query result graph, can span zero more levels of relations between resources. For example, a query could request regions in images on pages of books written by a certain author, articles by authors who were students of a particular professor, or authors of texts that refer to events that took place within a certain date range. Permission Checking Each matching resource is returned with the values that the user has permission to see. If the user does not have permission to see a matching main resource, it is hidden in the results. If a user does not have permission to see a matching dependent resource, the link value is hidden. Paging Gravsearch results are returned in pages. The maximum number of main resources per page is determined by Knora (and can be configured in application.conf via the setting app/v2/resources-sequence/results-per-page ). If some resources have been filtered out because the user does not have permission to see them, a page could contain fewer results, or no results. If it is possible that more results are available in subsequent pages, the Gravsearch response will contain the predicate knora-api:mayHaveMoreResults with the boolean value true , otherwise it will not contain this predicate. Therefore, to retrieve all available results, the client must request each page one at a time, until the response does not contain knora-api:mayHaveMoreResults . Inference Gravsearch queries are understood to imply a subset of RDFS reasoning . Depending on the triplestore being used, this may be implemented using the triplestore's own reasoner or by query expansion in Knora. Specifically, if a statement pattern specifies a property, the pattern will also match subproperties of that property, and if a statement specifies that a subject has a particular rdf:type , the statement will also match subjects belonging to subclasses of that type. If you know that reasoning will not return any additional results for your query, you can disable it by adding this line to the WHERE clause: knora-api:GravsearchOptions knora-api:useInference false . If Knora is implementing reasoning by query expansion, disabling it can improve the performance of some queries. Gravsearch Syntax Every Gravsearch query is a valid SPARQL 1.1 CONSTRUCT query. However, Gravsearch only supports a subset of the elements that can be used in a SPARQL Construct query, and a Gravsearch CONSTRUCT Clause has to indicate which variable is to be used for the main resource in each search result. Supported SPARQL Syntax The current version of Gravsearch accepts CONSTRUCT queries whose WHERE clauses use the following patterns, with the specified restrictions: OPTIONAL : cannot be nested in a UNION . UNION : cannot be nested in a UNION . FILTER : may contain a complex expression using the Boolean operators AND and OR, as well as comparison operators. The left argument of a comparison operator must be a query variable. A Knora ontology entity IRI used in a FILTER must be a property IRI. FILTER NOT EXISTS MINUS OFFSET : the OFFSET is needed for paging. It does not actually refer to the number of triples to be returned, but to the requested page of results. The default value is 0, which refers to the first page of results. ORDER BY : In SPARQL, the result of a CONSTRUCT query is an unordered set of triples. However, a Gravsearch query returns an ordered list of resources, which can be ordered by the values of specified properties. If the query is written in the complex schema, items below the level of Knora values may not be used in ORDER BY . BIND : The value assigned must be a Knora resource IRI. Resources, Properties, and Values Resources can be represented either by an IRI or by a variable, except for the main resource, which must be represented by a variable. It is possible to do a Gravsearch query in which the IRI of the main resource is already known, e.g. to request specific information about that resource and perhaps about linked resources. In this case, the IRI of the main resource must be assigned to a variable using BIND . Properties can be represented by an IRI or a query variable. If a property is represented by a query variable, it can be restricted to certain property IRIs using a FILTER . A Knora value (i.e. a value attached to a knora-api:Resource ) must be represented as a query variable. Filtering on Values Filtering on Values in the Simple Schema In the simple schema, a variable representing a Knora value can be used directly in a FILTER expression. For example: ?book incunabula:title ?title . FILTER(?title = \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\") Here the type of ?title is xsd:string . The following Knora value types can be compared with literals in FILTER expressions in the simple schema: Text values ( xsd:string ) Uri values ( xsd:anyURI ) Integer values ( xsd:integer ) Decimal values ( xsd:decimal ) Boolean values ( xsd:boolean ) Date values ( knora-api:Date ) List values ( knora-api:ListNode ) List values can only be searched for using the equal operator ( = ), performing an exact match on a list node's label. Labels can be given in different languages for a specific list node. If one of the given list node labels matches, it is considered a match. Note that in the simple schema, uniqueness is not guaranteed (as opposed to the complex schema). A Knora value may not be represented as the literal object of a predicate; for example, this is not allowed: ?book incunabula:title \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\" . Filtering on Values in the Complex Schema In the complex schema, variables representing Knora values are not literals. You must add something to the query (generally a statement) to get a literal from a Knora value. For example: ?book incunabula:title ?title . ?title knora-api:valueAsString \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\" . Here the type of ?title is knora-api:TextValue . Note that no FILTER is needed in this example. But if you want to use a different comparison operator, you need a FILTER : ?page incunabula:seqnum ?seqnum . ?seqnum knora-api:intValueAsInt ?seqnumInt . FILTER(?seqnumInt <= 10) To match a date value in the complex schema, you must use the knora-api:toSimpleDate function in a FILTER (see Date Comparisons ). The predicates of knora-api:DateValue ( knora-api:dateValueHasStartYear , etc.) are not available in Gravsearch. Date Comparisons In the simple schema, you can compare a date value directly with a knora-api:Date in a FILTER : ?book incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate . FILTER(?pubdate < \"JULIAN:1497\"^^knora-api:Date) In the complex schema, you must use the function knora-api:toSimpleDate , passing it the variable representing the date value. The date literal used in the comparison must still be a knora-api:Date in the simple schema. This is the only case in which you can use both schemas in a single query: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX knora-api-simple: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?book knora-api:isMainResource true . ?book incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate . } WHERE { ?book a incunabula:book . ?book incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate . FILTER(knora-api:toSimpleDate(?pubdate) < \"JULIAN:1497\"^^knora-api-simple:Date) } ORDER BY ?pubdate You can also use knora-api:toSimpleDate with to search for date tags in standoff text markup (see Matching Standoff Dates ). Note that the given date value for comparison must have the following format: ``` (GREGORIAN|JULIAN|ISLAMIC):\\d{1,4}(-\\d{1,2}(-\\d{1,2})?)?( BC| AD| BCE| CE)?(:\\d{1,4}(-\\d{1,2}(-\\d{1,2})?)?( BC| AD| BCE| CE)?)? ``` E.g. an exact date like GREGORIAN:2015-12-03 or a period like GREGORIAN:2015-12-03:2015-12-04 . Dates may also have month or year precision, e.g. ISLAMIC:1407-02 (the whole month of december) or JULIAN:1330 (the whole year 1330). An optional ERA indicator term ( BCE , CE , or BC , AD ) can be added to the date, when no era is provided the default era AD will be considered. Era can be given as GREGORIAN:1220 BC or in range as GREGORIAN:600 BC:480 BC . Searching for Matching Words The function knora-api:matchText searches for matching words anywhere in a text value, and is implemented using a full-text search index if available. The first argument must represent a text value (a knore-api:TextValue in the complex schema, or an xsd:string in the simple schema). The second argument is a string literal containing the words to be matched, separated by spaces. The function supports the Lucene Query Parser syntax . Note that Lucene's default operator is a logical OR when submitting several search terms. This function can only be used as the top-level expression in a FILTER . For example, to search for titles that contain the words 'Zeitgl\u00f6cklein' and 'Lebens': ?book incunabule:title ?title . FILTER knora-api:matchText(?title, \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein Lebens\") Filtering Text by Language To filter a text value by language in the simple schema, use the SPARQL lang function on the text value, e.g.: FILTER(lang(?text) = \"fr\") In the complex schema, the lang function is not supported. Use the text value's knora-api:textValueHasLanguage predicate instead: ?text knora-api:textValueHasLanguage \"fr\" . Regular Expressions The SPARQL regex function is supported. In the simple schema, you can use it directly on the text value, e.g. ?book incunabula:title ?title . FILTER regex(?title, \"Zeit\", \"i\") In the complex schema, use it on the object of the text value's knora-api:valueAsString predicate: ?book incunabula:title ?title . ?title knora-api:valueAsString ?titleStr . FILTER regex(?titleStr, \"Zeit\", \"i\") Searching for Text Markup To refer to standoff markup in text values, you must write your query in the complex schema. A knora-api:TextValue can have the property knora-api:textValueHasStandoff , whose objects are the standoff markup tags in the text. You can match the tags you're interested in using rdf:type or other properties of each tag. Matching Text in a Standoff Tag The function knora-api:matchTextInStandoff searches for standoff tags containing certain terms. The implementation is optimised using the full-text search index if available. The function takes three arguments: A variable representing a text value. A variable representing a standoff tag. A string literal containing space-separated search terms. This function can only be used as the top-level expression in a FILTER . For example: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#> PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . } WHERE { ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffParagraphTag . ?standoffParagraphTag a standoff:StandoffParagraphTag . FILTER knora-api:matchTextInStandoff(?text, ?standoffParagraphTag, \"Grund Richtigkeit\") } Here we are looking for letters containing the words \"Grund\" and \"Richtigkeit\" within a single paragraph. Matching Standoff Links If you are only interested in specifying that a resource has some text value containing a standoff link to another resource, the most efficient way is to use the property knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo , whose subjects and objects are resources. This property is automatically maintained by Knora. For example: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . } WHERE { ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person . ?person a beol:person . ?person beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iafIdentifier . ?iafIdentifier knora-api:valueAsString \"(VIAF)271899510\" . } Here we are looking for letters containing a link to the historian Claude Jordan, who is identified by his Integrated Authority File identifier, (VIAF)271899510 . However, if you need to specify the context in which the link tag occurs, you must use the function knora-api:standoffLink . It takes three arguments: A variable or IRI representing the resource that is the source of the link. A variable representing the standoff link tag. A variable or IRI representing the resource that is the target of the link. This function can only be used as the top-level expression in a FILTER . For example: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#> PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . } WHERE { ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffLinkTag . ?standoffLinkTag a knora-api:StandoffLinkTag . FILTER knora-api:standoffLink(?letter, ?standoffLinkTag, ?person) ?person a beol:person . ?person beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iafIdentifier . ?iafIdentifier knora-api:valueAsString \"(VIAF)271899510\" . ?standoffLinkTag knora-api:standoffTagHasStartParent ?standoffItalicTag . ?standoffItalicTag a standoff:StandoffItalicTag . } This has the same effect as the previous example, except that because we are matching the link tag itself, we can specify that its immediate parent is a StandoffItalicTag . If you actually want to get the target of the link (in this example, ?person ) in the search results, you need to add a statement like ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person . to the WHERE clause and to the CONSTRUCT clause: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#> PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person . } WHERE { ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffLinkTag . ?standoffLinkTag a knora-api:StandoffLinkTag . FILTER knora-api:standoffLink(?letter, ?standoffLinkTag, ?person) ?person a beol:person . ?person beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iafIdentifier . ?iafIdentifier knora-api:valueAsString \"(VIAF)271899510\" . ?standoffLinkTag knora-api:standoffTagHasStartParent ?standoffItalicTag . ?standoffItalicTag a standoff:StandoffItalicTag . ?letter knora-api:hasStandoffLinkTo ?person . } Matching Standoff Dates You can use the knora-api:toSimpleDate function (see @ref Date Comparisons ) to match dates in standoff date tags, i.e. instances of knora-api:StandoffDateTag or of one of its subclasses. For example, here we are looking for a text containing an anything:StandoffEventTag (which is a project-specific subclass of knora-api:StandoffDateTag ) representing an event that occurred sometime during the month of December 2016: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX anything: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#> PREFIX knora-api-simple: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?thing knora-api:isMainResource true . ?thing anything:hasText ?text . } WHERE { ?thing a anything:Thing . ?thing anything:hasText ?text . ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffEventTag . ?standoffEventTag a anything:StandoffEventTag . FILTER(knora-api:toSimpleDate(?standoffEventTag) = \"GREGORIAN:2016-12 CE\"^^knora-api-simple:Date) } Matching Ancestor Tags Suppose we want to search for a standoff date in a paragraph, but we know that the paragraph tag might not be the immediate parent of the date tag. For example, the date tag might be in an italics tag, which is in a paragraph tag. In that case, we can use the inferred property knora-api:standoffTagHasStartAncestor . We can modify the previous example to do this: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX standoff: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/standoff/v2#> PREFIX anything: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#> PREFIX knora-api-simple: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?thing knora-api:isMainResource true . ?thing anything:hasText ?text . } WHERE { ?thing a anything:Thing . ?thing anything:hasText ?text . ?text knora-api:textValueHasStandoff ?standoffDateTag . ?standoffDateTag a knora-api:StandoffDateTag . FILTER(knora-api:toSimpleDate(?standoffDateTag) = \"GREGORIAN:2016-12-24 CE\"^^knora-api-simple:Date) ?standoffDateTag knora-api:standoffTagHasStartAncestor ?standoffParagraphTag . ?standoffParagraphTag a standoff:StandoffParagraphTag . } Filtering on rdfs:label The rdfs:label of a resource is not a Knora value, but you can still search for it. This can be done in the same ways in the simple or complex schema: Using a string literal object: ?book rdfs:label \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\" . Using a variable and a FILTER: ?book rdfs:label ?label . FILTER(?label = \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\") Using the regex function: ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel . FILTER regex(?bookLabel, \"Zeit\", \"i\") To match words in an rdfs:label using the full-text search index, use the knora-api:matchLabel function, which works like knora-api:matchText , except that the first argument is a variable representing a resource: FILTER knora-api:matchLabel(?book, \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein\") Filtering on Resource IRIs A FILTER can compare a variable with another variable or IRI representing a resource. For example, to find a letter whose author and recipient are different persons: PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . } WHERE { ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . FILTER(?person1 != ?person2) . } OFFSET 0 To find a letter whose author is not a person with a specified IRI: PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . } WHERE { ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . FILTER(?person1 != <http://rdfh.ch/0801/F4n1xKa3TCiR4llJeElAGA>) . } OFFSET 0 CONSTRUCT Clause In the CONSTRUCT clause of a Gravsearch query, the variable representing the main resource must be indicated with knora-api:isMainResource true . Exactly one variable representing a resource must be marked in this way. Any other statements in the CONSTRUCT clause must also be present in the WHERE clause. If a variable representing a resource or value is used in the WHERE clause but not in the CONSTRUCT clause, the matching resources or values will not be included in the results. If the query is written in the complex schema, all variables in the CONSTRUCT clause must refer to Knora resources, Knora values, or properties. Data below the level of Knora values may not be mentioned in the CONSTRUCT clause. Predicates from the rdf , rdfs , and owl ontologies may not be used in the CONSTRUCT clause. The rdfs:label of each matching resource is always returned, so there is no need to mention it in the query. Gravsearch by Example In this section, we provide some sample queries of different complexity to illustrate the usage of Gravsearch. Getting All the Components of a Compound Resource In order to get all the components of a compound resource, the following Gravsearch query can be sent to the API. In this case, the compound resource is an incunabula:book identified by the IRI http://rdfh.ch/0803/c5058f3a and the components are of type incunabula:page (test data for the Incunabula project). Since inference is assumed, we can use knora-api:StillImageRepresentation ( incunabula:page is one of its subclasses). This makes the query more generic and allows for reuse (for instance, a client would like to query different types of compound resources defined in different ontologies). ORDER BY is used to sort the components by their sequence number. OFFSET is set to 0 to get the first page of results. PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?component knora-api:isMainResource true . # marking of the component searched for as the main resource, required ?component knora-api:seqnum ?seqnum . # return the sequence number in the response ?component knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue ?file . # return the StillImageFile in the response } WHERE { ?component a knora-api:StillImageRepresentation . # restriction of the type of component ?component knora-api:isPartOf <http://rdfh.ch/0803/c5058f3a> . # component relates to a compound resource via this property ?component knora-api:seqnum ?seqnum . # component must have a sequence number ?component knora-api:hasStillImageFileValue ?file . # component must have a StillImageFile } ORDER BY ASC(?seqnum) # order by sequence number, ascending OFFSET 0 # get first page of results The incunabula:book with the IRI http://rdfh.ch/0803/c5058f3a has 402 pages. (This result can be obtained by doing a count query; see Submitting Gravsearch Queries .) However, with OFFSET 0 , only the first page of results is returned. The same query can be sent again with OFFSET 1 to get the next page of results, and so forth. When a page of results is not full (see settings in app/v2 in application.conf ) or is empty, no more results are available. By design, it is not possible for the client to get more than one page of results at a time; this is intended to prevent performance problems that would be caused by huge responses. A client that wants to download all the results of a query must request each page sequentially. Let's assume the client is not interested in all of the book's pages, but just in first ten of them. In that case, the sequence number can be restricted using a FILTER that is added to the query's WHERE clause: FILTER (?seqnum <= 10) The first page starts with sequence number 1, so with this FILTER only the first ten pages are returned. This query would be exactly the same in the complex schema, except for the expansion of the knora-api prefix: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> Traversing Multiple Links Here we are looking for regions of pages that are part of books that have a particular title. In the simple schema: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?region knora-api:isMainResource true ; knora-api:isRegionOf ?page . ?page incunabula:partOf ?book . ?book incunabula:title ?title . } WHERE { ?region a knora-api:Region ; knora-api:isRegionOf ?page . ?page a incunabula:page ; incunabula:partOf ?book . ?book incunabula:title ?title . FILTER(?title = \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\") } In the complex schema: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?region knora-api:isMainResource true ; knora-api:isRegionOf ?page . ?page incunabula:partOf ?book . ?book incunabula:title ?title . } WHERE { ?region a knora-api:Region ; knora-api:isRegionOf ?page . ?page a incunabula:page ; incunabula:partOf ?book . ?book incunabula:title ?title . ?title knora-api:valueAsString \"Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens und Leidens Christi\" . } If we remove the line ?book incunabula:title ?title . from the CONSTRUCT clause, so that the CONSTRUCT clause no longer mentions ?title , the response will contain the same matching resources, but the titles of those resources will not be included in the response. Requesting a Graph Starting with a Known Resource Here the IRI of the main resource is already known, and we want specific information about it, as well as about related resources. In this case, the IRI of the main resource must be assigned to a variable using BIND : PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true ; beol:creationDate ?date ; ?linkingProp1 ?person1 . ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?familyName . } WHERE { BIND(<http://rdfh.ch/0801/_B3lQa6tSymIq7_7SowBsA> AS ?letter) ?letter a beol:letter ; beol:creationDate ?date ; ?linkingProp1 ?person1 . FILTER(?linkingProp1 = beol:hasAuthor || ?linkingProp1 = beol:hasRecipient) ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?familyName . } ORDER BY ?date This query would be the same in the complex schema, except for the prefix expansions: PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> Searching for a List Value Referring to a Particular List Node Since list nodes are represented by their Iri in the complex schema, uniqueness is guranteed (as opposed to the simple schema). Also all the subnodes of the given list node are considered a match. PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#> PREFIX anything: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?thing knora-api:isMainResource true . ?thing anything:hasListItem ?listItem . } WHERE { ?thing anything:hasListItem ?listItem . ?listItem knora-api:listValueAsListNode <http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/treeList02> . } Type Inference Gravsearch needs to be able to determine the types of the entities that query variables and IRIs refer to in the WHERE clause. In most cases, it can infer these from context and from the ontologies used. In particular, it needs to know: The type of the subject and object of each statement. The type that is expected as the object of each predicate. Type Annotations When one or more types cannot be inferred, Gravsearch will return an error message indicating the entities for which it could not determine types. The missing information must then be given by adding type annotations to the query. This can always done by adding statements with the predicate rdf:type . The subject must be a resource or value, and the object must either be knora-api:Resource (if the subject is a resource) or the subject's specific type (if it is a value). For example, consider this query that uses a non-Knora property: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> CONSTRUCT { ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ; dcterms:title ?title . } WHERE { ?book dcterms:title ?title . } This produces the error message: The types of one or more entities could not be determined: ?book, <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title>, ?title To solve this problem, it is enough to specify the types of ?book and ?title ; the type of the expected object of dcterms:title can then be inferred from the type of ?title . PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> CONSTRUCT { ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ; dcterms:title ?title . } WHERE { ?book rdf:type incunabula:book ; dcterms:title ?title . ?title rdf:type xsd:string . } It would also be possible to annotate the property itself, using the predicate knora-api:objectType ; then the type of ?title would be inferred: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> CONSTRUCT { ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ; dcterms:title ?title . } WHERE { ?book rdf:type incunabula:book ; dcterms:title ?title . dcterms:title knora-api:objectType xsd:string . } Note that it only makes sense to use dcterms:title in the simple schema, because its object is supposed to be a literal. Here is another example, using a non-Knora class: PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> CONSTRUCT { ?person knora-api:isMainResource true . } WHERE { ?person a foaf:Person . ?person foaf:familyName ?familyName . FILTER(?familyName = \"Meier\") } This produces the error message: Types could not be determined for one or more entities: ?person The solution is to specify that ?person is a knora-api:Resource : PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> CONSTRUCT { ?person knora-api:isMainResource true . } WHERE { ?person a foaf:Person . ?person a knora-api:Resource . ?person foaf:familyName ?familyName . FILTER(?familyName = \"Meier\") } Inconsistent Types Gravsearch will also reject a query if an entity is used with inconsistent types. For example: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ; incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate . } WHERE { ?book a incunabula:book ; incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate . FILTER(?pubdate = \"JULIAN:1497-03-01\") . } This returns the error message: One or more entities have inconsistent types: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#pubdate> knora-api:objectType <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#Date> ; knora-api:objectType <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> . ?pubdate rdf:type <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#Date> ; rdf:type <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> . This is because the incunabula ontology says that the object of incunabula:pubdate must be a knora-api:Date , but the FILTER expression compares ?pubdate with an xsd:string . The solution is to specify the type of the literal in the FILTER : PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?book knora-api:isMainResource true ; incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate . } WHERE { ?book a incunabula:book ; incunabula:pubdate ?pubdate .

It also has the benefit of enabling clients to work with a simpler RDF data model than the one Knora actually uses to store data in the triplestore, and makes it possible to provide better error-checking. Rather than being processed directly by the triplestore, a Gravsearch query is interpreted by Knora, which enforces certain restrictions on the query, and implements paging and permission checking. The API server generates SPARQL based on the Gravsearch query submitted, queries the triplestore, filters the results according to the user's permissions, and returns each page of query results as a Knora API response. Thus, Gravsearch is a hybrid between a RESTful API and a SPARQL endpoint. A Gravsearch query conforms to a subset of the syntax of a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query, with some additional restrictions and functionality. In particular, the variable representing the top-level (or 'main') resource that will appear in each search result must be identified, statements must be included to specify the types of the entities being queried, OFFSET is used to control paging, and ORDER BY is used to sort the results.

Reading resources may require authentication, since some resources may have restricted viewing permissions. Responses Describing Resources Resources can be returned in JSON-LD , Turtle , or RDF/XML , using HTTP content negotiation (see Response Formats ). Operations for reading and searching resources can return responses in either the simple or the complex ontology schema. The complex schema is used by default. To receive a response in the simple schema, use the HTTP request header or URL parameter described in API Schema . Each Knora API v2 response describing one or more resources returns a single RDF graph. For example, a request for a single resource returns that resource and all its values. In a full-text search, the resource is returned with the values that matched the search criteria. A response to an extended search may represent a whole graph of interconnected resources. In JSON-LD, if only one resource is returned, it is the top-level object; if more than one resource is returned, they are represented as an array of objects of the @graph member of the top-level object (see Named Graphs in the JSON-LD specification). In the complex schema, dependent resources, i.e. resources that are referred to by other resources on the top level, are nested in link value objects. If resources on the top level are referred to by other resources and these links are part of the response, virtual incoming links are generated; see Gravsearch: Virtual Graph Search ). See the interfaces Resource and ResourcesSequence in module ResourcesResponse (exists for both API schemas: ApiV2Simple and ApiV2WithValueObjects ). Text Markup Options Text markup can be returned in one of two ways: As XML embedded in the response, using an XML to Standoff Mapping . As standoff/RDF , which is Knora's internal markup representation. Embedded XML is the default. Implementation of support for standoff/RDF in API v2 is in its early stages. The basic procedure works like this: First, request a resource in the complex schema , using any relevant API v2 route, submitting the string standoff as the value of either: the HTTP header X-Knora-Accept-Markup the URL parameter markup If a text value in the resource contains markup, the text value will look something like this: { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/LK-wKXDNQJaRHOf0F0aJ2g/values/1Er1OpVwQR2u6peTwyNpJw\", \"@type\" : \"knora-api:TextValue\", \"knora-api:attachedToUser\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/users/9XBCrDV3SRa7kS1WwynB4Q\" }, \"knora-api:hasPermissions\" : \"CR knora-admin:Creator|V knora-admin:UnknownUser\", \"knora-api:textValueHasMarkup\" : true, \"knora-api:textValueHasMaxStandoffStartIndex\" : 6737, \"knora-api:userHasPermission\" : \"CR\", \"knora-api:valueAsString\" : \"\\nHamlet\\nACT I\\nSCENE I.

The predicate knora-api:textValueHasMarkup indicates that the text value has markup, and the value of the predicate knora-api:textValueHasMaxStandoffStartIndex gives the start index of the last standoff tag; this gives the client some idea of how much markup there is. You can then request the text value's standoff/RDF, which is returned in pages of a limited size. To get each page: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/standoff/RESOURCE_IRI/TEXT_VALUE_IRI/OFFSET Both RESOURCE_IRI and TEXT_VALUE_IRI must be URL-encoded. The offset is an integer whose initial value is 0.

If there are more pages of standoff to be requested, the response will contain knora-api:nextStandoffStartIndex , whose object should be submitted as the next OFFSET to the same route. This continues until you receive a response without knora-api:nextStandoffStartIndex . Get the Representation of a Resource by IRI Get a Full Representation of a Resource by IRI A full representation of resource can be obtained by making a GET request to the API providing its IRI. Because a Knora IRI has the format of a URL, its IRI has to be URL-encoded. To get the resource with the IRI http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a (a book from the sample Incunabula project, which is included in the Knora API server's test data), make a HTTP GET request to the resources route (path segment resources in the API call) and append the URL-encoded IRI: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a If necessary, several resources can be queried at the same time, their IRIs separated by slashes. Please note that the amount of resources that can be queried in one requested is limited. See the settings for app/v2 in application.conf . More formally, the URL looks like this: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resources/resourceIRI(/anotherResourceIri)* Get a Full Representation of a Version of a Resource by IRI To get a specific past version of a resource, use the route described in Get a Full Representation of a Resource by IRI , and add the URL parameter ?version=TIMESTAMP , where TIMESTAMP is an xsd:dateTimeStamp in the UTC timezone. The timestamp can either be URL-encoded, or submitted with all punctuation ( - , : , and . ) removed (this is to accept timestamps from Knora's ARK URLs ). The resource will be returned with the values that it had at the specified time. Since Knora only versions values, not resource metadata (e.g. rdfs:label ), the current metadata will be returned. Each value will be returned with the permissions that are attached to the current version of the value (see Permissions ). The returned resource will include the predicate knora-api:versionDate , containing the timestamp that was submitted, and its knora-api:versionArkUrl (see Resource Permalinks ) will contain the same timestamp. Get a Value in a Resource To get a specific value of a resource, use this route: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/values/resourceIRI/valueUUID The resource IRI must be URL-encoded. The path element valueUUID is the string object of the value's knora-api:valueHasUUID . The value will be returned within its containing resource, in the same format as for Responses Describing Resources , but without any of the resource's other values. Get a Version of a Value in a Resource To get a particular version of a specific value of a resource, use the route described in Get a Value in a Resource , and add the URL parameter ?version=TIMESTAMP , where TIMESTAMP is an xsd:dateTimeStamp in the UTC timezone. The timestamp can either be URL-encoded, or submitted with all punctuation ( - , : , and . ) removed (this is to accept timestamps from Knora's ARK URLs ). The value will be returned within its containing resource, in the same format as for Responses Describing Resources , but without any of the resource's other values. Since Knora only versions values, not resource metadata (e.g. rdfs:label ), the current resource metadata will be returned. The value will be returned with the permissions that are attached to its current version (see Permissions ). Get the Version History of a Resource To get a list of the changes that have been made to a resource since its creation, use this route: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resources/history/resourceIRI[?startDate=START_DATE&endDate=END_DATE] The resource IRI must be URL-encoded. The start and end dates are optional, and are URL-encoded timestamps in xsd:dateTimeStamp format. The start date is inclusive, and the end date is exclusive. If the start date is not provided, the resource's history since its creation is returned. If the end date is not provided, the resource's history up to the present is returned. The response is a list of changes made to the resource, in reverse chronological order. Each entry has the properties knora-api:author (the IRI of the user who made the change) and knora-api:versionDate (the date when the change was made). For example: { \"@graph\" : [ { \"knora-api:author\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/users/BhkfBc3hTeS_IDo-JgXRbQ\" }, \"knora-api:versionDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2019-02-11T09:05:10Z\" } }, { \"knora-api:author\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/users/9XBCrDV3SRa7kS1WwynB4Q\" }, \"knora-api:versionDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2019-02-10T10:30:10Z\" } }, { \"knora-api:author\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/users/BhkfBc3hTeS_IDo-JgXRbQ\" }, \"knora-api:versionDate\" : { \"@type\" : \"xsd:dateTimeStamp\", \"@value\" : \"2019-02-10T10:05:10Z\" } } ], \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\" } } The entries include all the dates when the resource's values were created or modified (within the requested date range), as well as the date when the resource was created (if the requested date range allows it). Each date is included only once. Since Knora only versions values, not resource metadata (e.g. rdfs:label ), changes to a resource's metadata are not included in its version history. To request the resource as it was at each of these dates, see Get a Full Representation of a Version of a Resource by IRI . For consistency in citation, we recommend using these dates when requesting resource versions. Get the preview of a resource by IRI In some cases, the client may only want to request the preview of a resource, which just provides its metadata (e.g. its IRI, rdfs:label , and type), without its values. This works exactly like making a conventional resource request, using the path segment resourcespreview : HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resourcespreview/resourceIRI(/anotherResourceIri)* Get a Graph of Resources Knora can return a graph of connections between resources, e.g. for generating a network diagram. HTTP GET to http://host/v2/graph/resourceIRI[depth=Integer] [direction=outbound|inbound|both][excludeProperty=propertyIri] The first parameter must be preceded by a question mark ? , any following parameter by an ampersand & . depth must be at least 1. The maximum depth is an Knora configuration setting. The default is 4. direction specifies the direction of the links to be queried, i.e. links to and/or from the given resource. The default is outbound . excludeProperty is an optional link property to be excluded from the results. To accommodate large graphs, the graph response format is very concise, and is therefore simpler than the usual resources response format. Each resource represented only by its IRI, class, and label. Direct links are shown instead of link values. For example: { \"@graph\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/0C-0L1kORryKzJAJxxRyRQ\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Sierra\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/A67ka6UQRHWf313tbhQBjw\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Victor\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/Lz7WEqJETJqqsUZQYexBQg\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"rdfs:label\" : \"Foxtrot\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/WLSHxQUgTOmG1T0lBU2r5w\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasOtherThing\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/A67ka6UQRHWf313tbhQBjw\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"Tango\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/start\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasOtherThing\" : [ { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/0C-0L1kORryKzJAJxxRyRQ\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/WLSHxQUgTOmG1T0lBU2r5w\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/tPfZeNMvRVujCQqbIbvO0A\" } ], \"rdfs:label\" : \"Romeo\" }, { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/tPfZeNMvRVujCQqbIbvO0A\", \"@type\" : \"anything:Thing\", \"anything:hasOtherThing\" : { \"@id\" : \"http://rdfh.ch/0001/Lz7WEqJETJqqsUZQYexBQg\" }, \"rdfs:label\" : \"Echo\" } ], \"@context\" : { \"rdf\" : \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\", \"knora-api\" : \"http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/v2#\", \"rdfs\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\", \"xsd\" : \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\", \"anything\" : \"http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#\" } } Search for Resources Search for a Resource by its rdfs:label Knora offers the possibility to search for resources by their rdfs:label . The use case for this search is to find a specific resource as you type. E.g., the user wants to get a list of resources whose rdfs:label contain some search terms separated by a whitespace character: Zeit Zeitg ... Zeitgl\u00f6cklein d ... Zeitgl\u00f6cklein des Lebens With each character added to the last term, the selection gets more specific. The first term should at least contain four characters. To make this kind of \"search as you type\" possible, a wildcard character is automatically added to the last search term. Search by label automatically adds Lucene operators, search strings are expected not to contain any characters with a special meaning in Lucene Query Parser syntax . HTTP GET to http://host/v2/searchbylabel/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI] [limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer] The first parameter must be preceded by a question mark ? , any following parameter by an ampersand & . The default value for the parameter offset is 0, which returns the first page of search results. Subsequent pages of results can be fetched by increasing offset by one. The amount of results per page is defined in app/v2 in application.conf . For performance reasons, standoff markup is not queried for this route. To request the number of results rather than the results themselves, you can do a count query: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/searchbylabel/count/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI][limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer] The response to a count query request is an object with one predicate, http://schema.org/numberOfItems , with an integer value. Full-text Search Knora offers a full-text search that searches through all textual representations of values and rdfs:label of resources. Full-text search supports the Lucene Query Parser syntax . Note that Lucene's default operator is a logical OR when submitting several search terms. Please note that the search terms have to be URL-encoded. HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI] [limitToStandoffClass=standoffClassIri][limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer] The first parameter has to be preceded by a question mark ? , any following parameter by an ampersand & . A search value must have a minimal length of three characters (default value) as defined in app/v2 in application.conf . A search term may contain wildcards. A ? represents a single character. It has to be URL-encoded as %3F since it has a special meaning in the URL syntax. For example, the term Uniform can be search for like this: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/Unif%3Frm A * represents zero, one or multiple characters. For example, the term Uniform can be searched for like this: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/Uni*m The default value for the parameter offset is 0 which returns the first page of search results. Subsequent pages of results can be fetched by increasing offset by one. The amount of results per page is defined in app/v2 in application.conf . If the parameter limitToStandoffClass is provided, Knora will look for search terms that are marked up with the indicated standoff class. To request the number of results rather than the results themselves, you can do a count query: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/search/count/searchValue[limitToResourceClass=resourceClassIRI][limitToStandoffClass=standoffClassIri][limitToProject=projectIRI][offset=Integer] The first parameter has to be preceded by a question mark ? , any following parameter by an ampersand & . The response to a count query request is an object with one predicate, http://schema.org/numberOfItems , with an integer value. Gravsearch For more complex queries than a full-text search, Knora offers a query language called Gravsearch: Virtual Graph Search ). Support of TEI/XML To convert standoff markup to TEI/XML, see TEI/XML . Reading Resources by Class from a Project To facilitate the development of tabular user interfaces for data entry, it is possible to get a paged list of all the resources belonging to a particular class in a given project, sorted by the value of a property: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/resources?resourceClass=RESOURCE_CLASS_IRI&page=PAGE[&orderByProperty=PROPERTY_IRI] This is useful only if the project does not contain a large amount of data; otherwise, you should use Gravsearch to search using more specific criteria. The specified class and property are used without inference; they will not match subclasses or subproperties. The HTTP header X-Knora-Accept-Project must be submitted; its value is a Knora project IRI. In the request URL, the values of resourceClass and orderByProperty are URL-encoded IRIs in the complex schema . The orderByProperty parameter is optional; if it is not supplied, resources will be sorted alphabetically by resource IRI (an arbitrary but consistent order). The value of page is a 0-based integer page number. Paging works as it does in Gravsearch ).","title":"Reading and Searching Resources"},{"location":"03-apis/api-v2/reading-and-searching-resources/#reading-and-searching-resources","text":"To retrieve an existing resource, the HTTP method GET has to be used.

The conversion is based on the assumption that a whole resource is to be turned into a TEI document. There is a basic distinction between the body and the header of a TEI document. The resource's property that contains the text with standoff markup is mapped to the TEI document's body. Other of the resource's property may be mapped to the TEI header. Standard Standoff to TEI Conversion Knora offers a built-in conversion form standard standoff entities (defined in the standoff ontology) tags to TEI. In order to obtain a resource as a TEI document, the following request has to be performed. Please note that the URL parameters have to be URL-encoded. HTTP GET to http://host/v2/tei/resourceIri?textProperty=textPropertyIri In addition to the resource's Iri, the Iri of the property containing the text with standoff has to be submitted. This will be converted to the TEI body. Please note that the resource can only have one instance of this property and the text must have standoff markup. The Knora test data contain the resource http://rdfh.ch/0001/thing_with_richtext_with_markup with the text property http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0001/anything/v2#hasRichtext that can be converted to TEI as follows: HTTP GET to http://host/v2/tei/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2F0001%2Fthing_with_richtext_with_markup?textProperty=http%3A%2F%2F0.0.0.0%3A3333%2Fontology%2F0001%2Fanything%2Fv2%23hasRichtext The answer to this request is a TEI XML document: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <TEI xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" version=\"3.3.0\"> <teiHeader> <fileDesc> <titleStmt> <title>test thing with markup</title> </titleStmt> <publicationStmt> <p> This is the TEI/XML representation of a resource identified by the Iri http://rdfh.ch/0001/thing_with_richtext_with_markup. </p> </publicationStmt> <sourceDesc> <p>Representation of the resource's text as TEI/XML</p> </sourceDesc> </fileDesc> </teiHeader> <text> <body> <p>This is a test that contains marked up elements. This is <hi rend=\"italic\">interesting text</hi> in italics. This is <hi rend=\"italic\">boring text</hi> in italics.</p> </body> </text> </TEI> The body of the TEI document contains the standoff markup as XML. The header contains contains some basic metadata about the resource such as the rdfs:label an its IRI. However, this might not be sufficient for more advanced use cases like digital edition projects. In that case, a custom conversion has to be performed (see below). Custom Conversion If a project defines its own standoff entities, a custom conversion can be provided (body of the TEI document). Also for the TEI header, a custom conversion can be provided. For the custom conversion, additional configuration is required. TEI body: additional mapping from standoff to XML (URL parameter mappingIri ) XSL transformation to turn the XML into a valid TEI body (referred to by the mapping). The mapping has to refer to a defaultXSLTransformation that transforms the XML that was created from standoff markup (see XML To Standoff Mapping in API v1 ). This step is necessary because the mapping assumes a one to one relation between standoff classes and properties and XML elements and attributes. For example, we may want to convert a standoff:StandoffItalicTag into TEI/XML. TEI expresses this as <hi rend=\"italic\">...</hi> . In the mapping, the standoff:StandoffItalicTag may be mapped to a a temporary XML element that is going to be converted to <hi rend=\"italic\">...</hi> in a further step by the XSLT. For sample data, see webapi/_test_data/test_route/texts/beol/BEOLTEIMapping.xml (mapping) and webapi/_test_data/test_route/texts/beol/standoffToTEI.xsl . The standoff entities are defined in beol-onto.ttl . TEI header: Gravsearch template to query the resources metadata, results are serialized to RDF/XML (URL parameter gravsearchTemplateIri ) XSL transformation to turn that RDF/XML into a valid TEI header (URL parameter teiHeaderXSLTIri ) The Gravsearch template is expected to be of type knora-base:TextRepresentation and to contain a placeholder $resourceIri that is to be replaced by the actual resource Iri. The Gravsearch template is expected to contain a query involving the text property (URL parameter textProperty ) and more properties that are going to be mapped to the TEI header. The Gravsearch template is a simple text file with the files extension .txt . A Gravsearch template may look like this (see test_data/test_route/texts/beol/gravsearch.txt ): PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:creationDate ?date . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?name1 . ?person1 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName1 . ?person1 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf1 . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . ?person2 beol:hasFamilyName ?name2 . ?person2 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName2 . ?person2 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf2 . } WHERE { BIND(<$resourceIri> as ?letter) ?letter a knora-api:Resource . ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:creationDate ?date . beol:creationDate knora-api:objectType knora-api:Date . ?date a knora-api:Date . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . beol:hasText knora-api:objectType xsd:string . ?text a xsd:string . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?name1 . ?person1 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName1 . ?person1 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf1 . ?name1 a xsd:string . ?givenName1 a xsd:string . ?iaf1 a xsd:string . ?person2 beol:hasFamilyName ?name2 . ?person2 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName2 . ?person2 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf2 . ?name2 a xsd:string . ?givenName2 a xsd:string . ?iaf2 a xsd:string . beol:hasGivenName knora-api:objectType xsd:string . beol:hasFamilyName knora-api:objectType xsd:string . beol:hasIAFIdentifier knora-api:objectType xsd:string . beol:hasAuthor knora-api:objectType knora-api:Resource . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . beol:hasRecipient knora-api:objectType knora-api:Resource . ?person1 a knora-api:Resource . ?person2 a knora-api:Resource . } Note the placeholder BIND(<$resourceIri> as ?letter) that is going to be replaced by the Iri of the resource the request is performed for. The query asks for information about the letter's text beol:hasText and information about its author and recipient. This information is converted to the TEI header in the format required by correspSearch .

Also for the TEI header, a custom conversion can be provided. For the custom conversion, additional configuration is required. TEI body: additional mapping from standoff to XML (URL parameter mappingIri ) XSL transformation to turn the XML into a valid TEI body (referred to by the mapping). The mapping has to refer to a defaultXSLTransformation that transforms the XML that was created from standoff markup (see XML To Standoff Mapping in API v1 ). This step is necessary because the mapping assumes a one to one relation between standoff classes and properties and XML elements and attributes. For example, we may want to convert a standoff:StandoffItalicTag into TEI/XML. TEI expresses this as <hi rend=\"italic\">...</hi> . In the mapping, the standoff:StandoffItalicTag may be mapped to a a temporary XML element that is going to be converted to <hi rend=\"italic\">...</hi> in a further step by the XSLT. For sample data, see webapi/_test_data/test_route/texts/beol/BEOLTEIMapping.xml (mapping) and webapi/_test_data/test_route/texts/beol/standoffToTEI.xsl . The standoff entities are defined in beol-onto.ttl . TEI header: Gravsearch template to query the resources metadata, results are serialized to RDF/XML (URL parameter gravsearchTemplateIri ) XSL transformation to turn that RDF/XML into a valid TEI header (URL parameter teiHeaderXSLTIri ) The Gravsearch template is expected to be of type knora-base:TextRepresentation and to contain a placeholder $resourceIri that is to be replaced by the actual resource Iri. The Gravsearch template is expected to contain a query involving the text property (URL parameter textProperty ) and more properties that are going to be mapped to the TEI header. The Gravsearch template is a simple text file with the files extension .txt . A Gravsearch template may look like this (see test_data/test_route/texts/beol/gravsearch.txt ): PREFIX beol: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0801/beol/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> CONSTRUCT { ?letter knora-api:isMainResource true . ?letter beol:creationDate ?date . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?name1 . ?person1 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName1 . ?person1 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf1 . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . ?person2 beol:hasFamilyName ?name2 . ?person2 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName2 . ?person2 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf2 . } WHERE { BIND(<$resourceIri> as ?letter) ?letter a knora-api:Resource . ?letter a beol:letter . ?letter beol:creationDate ?date . beol:creationDate knora-api:objectType knora-api:Date . ?date a knora-api:Date . ?letter beol:hasText ?text . beol:hasText knora-api:objectType xsd:string . ?text a xsd:string . ?letter beol:hasAuthor ?person1 . ?person1 beol:hasFamilyName ?name1 . ?person1 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName1 . ?person1 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf1 . ?name1 a xsd:string . ?givenName1 a xsd:string . ?iaf1 a xsd:string . ?person2 beol:hasFamilyName ?name2 . ?person2 beol:hasGivenName ?givenName2 . ?person2 beol:hasIAFIdentifier ?iaf2 . ?name2 a xsd:string . ?givenName2 a xsd:string . ?iaf2 a xsd:string . beol:hasGivenName knora-api:objectType xsd:string . beol:hasFamilyName knora-api:objectType xsd:string . beol:hasIAFIdentifier knora-api:objectType xsd:string . beol:hasAuthor knora-api:objectType knora-api:Resource . ?letter beol:hasRecipient ?person2 . beol:hasRecipient knora-api:objectType knora-api:Resource . ?person1 a knora-api:Resource . ?person2 a knora-api:Resource . } Note the placeholder BIND(<$resourceIri> as ?letter) that is going to be replaced by the Iri of the resource the request is performed for. The query asks for information about the letter's text beol:hasText and information about its author and recipient.

Implementation All administration functions will be implemented as part of the Knora API in the webapi codebase. There is also a separate web-application as part of the salsah codebase using this API, allowing basic management operations. Overview During the initial deployment of a Knora server, the main administration user ( root ) is created. This root user has the right to do anything. Knora\u2019s concept of access control is that permissions can only be granted to groups (or the whole project, i.e. all members of a project) and not to individual users. There are two distinct ways of granting permission. Firstly, an object (a resource or value) can grant permissions to groups of users, and secondly, permissions can be granted directly to a group of users (not bound to a specific object). There are six built-in groups: UnknownUser , KnownUser , Creator , ProjectMember , ProjectAdmin , and SystemAdmin . These groups can be used in the same way as normal user created groups for permission management, i.e. can be used to give certain groups of users, certain permissions, without the need to explicitly create them. A user becomes implicitly a member of such a group by satisfying certain conditions: knora-admin:UnknownUser : Any user who has not logged into Knora is automatically assigned to this group. knora-admin:KnownUser : Any user who has logged into Knora is automatically assigned to this group. knora-admin:Creator : When checking a user\u2019s permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if he is the creator of the object. knora-admin:ProjectMember : When checking a user\u2019s permissions, the user is automatically assigned to this group by being a member of a project designated by the knora-admin:isInProject property. knora-admin:ProjectAdmin : When checking a user's permission, the user is automatically assigned to this group through the knora-admin:isInProjectAdminGroup property, which points to the project in question. knora-admin:SystemAdmin : Membership is received by setting the property knora-admin:isInSystemAdminGroup to true on a knora-admin:User . To use these build-in groups as values for properties (Object Access and Default Permissions), the IRI is constructed by appending the name of the built-in group to knora-admin , e.g., knora-admin:KnownUser where knora-admin corresponds to http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin# . Permissions Up until know, we have mentioned two groups of permissions. The first called object access permissions , which contains permissions that point from explicit objects (resources/values) to groups. The second group of permissions called administrative permissions , and which contains permissions that are put on instances of knora-admin:Permission objects directly affecting groups. There is another, third group of permissions, called default object access permissions which is also put on instances of knora-admin:Permission , and which also directly affect groups. Object Access Permissions An object (resource / value) can grant the following permissions, which are stored in a compact format in a single string, which is the object of the predicate knora-base:hasPermissions : Restricted view permission (RV) : Allows a restricted view of the object, e.g. a view of an image with a watermark. View permission (V) : Allows an unrestricted view of the object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the user\u2019s ability to view information about the resource other than its values. To view a value, she must have view permission on the value itself. Modify permission (M) : For values, this permission allows a new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows the user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an existing value), or to change information about the resource other than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value, his permissions on the containing resource are not relevant. However, when he wants to change the target of a link, the old link must be deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify permission on the resource. Delete permission (D) : Allows the item to be marked as deleted. Change rights permission (CR) : Allows the permissions granted by the object to be changed. Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered permissions. A user\u2019s permission level on a particular object is calculated in the following way: Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including Creator and/or ProjectMember and/or ProjectAdmin if applicable. Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the object, by iterating over the permissions that the object grants. For each permission, if she is in the specified group, add the specified permission to the list of permissions she can obtain. From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission. If the result is that she would have no permissions, give her whatever permission UnknownUser would have. The format of the object of knora-base:hasPermissions is as follows: Each permission is represented by the one-letter or two-letter abbreviation given above. Each permission abbreviation is followed by a space, then a comma-separated list of groups that the permission is granted to. The IRIs of built-in groups are shortened using the knora-admin prefix. Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (|). For example, if an object grants view permission to unknown and known users , and modify permission to project members , the resulting permission literal would be: : V knora-admin:UnknownUser,knora-admin:KnownUser|M knora-admin:ProjectMember Administrative Permissions The following permissions can be set via instances of knora-admin:AdministrativePermission on any group belonging to a project. For users that are members of a number of groups with administrative permissions attached, the final set of permissions is additive and most permissive. The administrative permissions are stored in a compact format in a single string, which is the object of the predicate knora-base:hasPermissions attached to an instance of the knora-admin:AdministrativePermission class. The following permission values can be used: Resource / Value Creation Permissions: 1) ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission : description: gives the permission to create resources inside the project. usage: used as a value for knora-base:hasPermissions . 2) ProjectResourceCreateRestrictedPermission : description: gives restricted resource creation permission inside the project. usage: used as a value for knora-base:hasPermissions . value: RestrictedProjectResourceCreatePermission followed by a comma-separated list of ResourceClasses the user should only be able to create instances of. Project Administration Permissions: 1) ProjectAdminAllPermission : description: gives the user the permission to do anything on project level, i.e. create new groups, modify all existing groups ( group info , group membership , resource creation permissions , project administration permissions , and default permissions ). usage: used as a value for knora-base:hasPermissions . 2) ProjectAdminGroupAllPermission : description: gives the user the permission to modify group info and group membership on all groups belonging to the project. usage: used as a value for the knora-base:hasPermissions property. 3) ProjectAdminGroupRestrictedPermission : description: gives the user the permission to modify group info and group membership on certain groups belonging to the project. usage: used as a value for knora-base:hasPermissions value: ProjectGroupAdminRestrictedPermission followed by a comma-separated list of knora-admin:UserGroup . 4) ProjectAdminRightsAllPermission : description: gives the user the permission to change the permissions on all objects belonging to the project (e.g., default permissions attached to groups and permissions on objects). usage: used as a value for the knora-base:hasPermissions property. Ontology Administration Permissions: 1) ProjectAdminOntologyAllPermission : description: gives the user the permission to administer the project ontologies usage: used as a value for the knora-base:hasPermissions property. The administrative permissions are stored in a compact format in a single string, which is the object of the predicate knora-base:hasPermissions attached to an instance of the knora-admin:AdministrativePermission class. The format of the object of knora-base:hasPermissions is as follows: Each permission is represented by the name given above. Each permission is followed by a space, then if applicable, by a comma separated list of IRIs, as defined above. The IRIs of built-in values (e.g., built-in groups, resource classes, etc.) are shortened using the knora-admin prefix knora-admin: . Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (|). For example, if an administrative permission grants the knora-admin:ProjectMember group the permission to create all resources ( ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission ), the resulting administrative permission object with the compact form literal would be: : <http://rdfh.ch/permissions/001 rdf:type knora-admin:AdministrativePermission ; knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>; knora-admin:forGroup knora-admin:ProjectMember ; knora-base:hasPermissions \"ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission\"^^xsd:string . Default Object Access Permissions Default Object Access Permissions are used when new objects (resources and/or values) are created. They represent object access permissions with which the new object will be initially outfitted. As with administrative permissions, these default object access permissions can be defined for any number of groups. Additionally, they can be also defined for resource classes and properties. The following default object access permissions can be attached to groups, resource classes and/or properties via instances of knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission (described further bellow). The default object access permissions correspond to the earlier described object access permission: Default Restricted View Permission (RV) : description: any object, created by a user inside a group holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission value: RV followed by a comma-separated list of knora-admin:UserGroup Default View Permission (V) : description: any object, created by a user inside a group holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission value: V followed by a comma-separated list of knora-admin:UserGroup Default Modify Permission (M) accompanied by a list of groups. description: any object, created by a user inside a group holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission value: M followed by a comma-separated list of knora-admin:UserGroup Default Delete Permission (D) accompanied by a list of groups. description: any object, created by a user inside a group holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission value: D followed by a comma-separated list of knora-admin:UserGroup Default Change Rights Permission (CR) accompanied by a list of groups. description: any object, created by a user inside a group holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission value: CR followed by a comma-separated list of knora-admin:UserGroup A single instance of knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission must always reference a project, but can only reference either a group ( knora-admin:forGroup property), a resource class ( knora-admin:forResourceClass ), a property ( knora-admin:forProperty ), or a combination of resource class and property. Example default object access permission instance: <http://rdfh.ch/permissions/002 rdf:type knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission ; knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>; knora-admin:forGroup knora-admin:ProjectMember ; knora-base:hasPermissions \"CR knora-admin:Creator|M knora-admin:ProjectMember|V knora-admin:KnownUser\"^^xsd:string . This instance is setting default object access permissions to the project member group of a project, giving change right permission to the creator, modify permission to all project members, and view permission to known users. Further, this implicitly applies to all resource classes and all their properties inside the project. Permission Precedence Rules For both administrative permissions and default object access permissions, the resulting permissions are derived by applying precedence rules, for the case that the user is member of more than one group. The following list is sorted by the permission precedence level in descending order: permissions on knora-admin:ProjectAdmin (highest level) permissions on resource classes and property combination (own project) permissions on resource classes and property combination ( knora-admin:SystemProject ) permissions on resource classes / properties (own project) permissions on resource classes / properties ( knora-admin:SystemProject ) permissions on custom groups permissions on knora-admin:ProjectMember permissions on knora-admin:KnownUser (lowest level) The permissions on resource classes / properties are only relevant for default object access permissions. Administrative Permissions : When a user performs an operation requiring administrative permissions, then only the permissions from the highest level are taken into account. If a user is a member of more than one group on the same level (only possible for custom groups) then the defined permissions are summed up and all are taken into account. Default Object Access Permissions : When a user creates a resource or value, then only the default object permissions from the highest level are applied. If a user is a member of more than one group on the same level (only possible for custom groups) then the defined permissions are summed up and the most permissive are applied. In the case of users belonging to the SystemAdmin group, but which are not members of a project and thus no group belonging to the project, the default object access permissions from the highest defined level will apply. In the case of users belonging to the SystemAdmin group , but which are not members of a project and thus not members of any group belonging to the project, the default object access permissions from the ProjectAdmin , ProjectMember , or KnownUser group will be applied in the order of precedence. If no permissions are defined on either of these groups, then the resulting permission will be CR knora-admin:Creator . Also, in the case that no default object access permissions are defined for the project, the resulting permission will be CR knora-admin:Creator . Implicit Permissions The knora-admin:SystemAdmin group receives implicitly the following permissions: receives implicitly ProjectAllAdminPermission for all projects. receives implicitly ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission for all projects. receives implicitly CR on all objects from all projects. Theses permissions are baked into the system, and cannot be changed. Permission Templates The permission capabilities of Knora are very large, as it needs to be able to satisfy a broad set of requirements. To simplify permission management for the users, we provide permission templates, which can be used during creation of new projects, or applied to existing projects. A permission template defines a set of administrative and default object access permission. Currently, two different templates will be defined OPEN , CLOSED . Template: OPEN The OPEN template defines the following permissions: The knora-admin:ProjectAdmin group: receives explicitly ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission . receives explicitly ProjectAllAdminPermission . The knora-admin:ProjectMember group: receives explicitly ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission . receives explicitly CR for the knora-admin:Creator and knora-admin:ProjectAdmin group. receives explicitly M for the ProjectMember group. receives explicitly V for the knora-admin:KnownUser group. Template: CLOSED The CLOSED template, defined the following permissions: The knora-admin:ProjectAdmin group: receives explicitly ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission . receives explicitly ProjectAllAdminPermission . The knora-admin:ProjectMember group: receives explicitly ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission . receives explicitly CR for the knora-admin:ProjectAdmin group. receives explicitly M for the ProjectMember group. Default Permissions Matrix for new Projects The access control matrix defines what are the default operations a subject (i.e. User), being a member of a built-in group (represented by row headers), is permitted to perform on an object (represented by column headers). The different operation abbreviations used are defined as follows: C : Create - the subject inside the group is allowed to create the object. U : Update - the subject inside the group is allowed to update the object. R : Read - the subject inside the group is allowed to read all information about the object. D : Delete - the subject inside the group is allowed to delete the object. P : Permission - the subject inside the group is allowed to change the permissions on the object. - : none - none or not applicable Built-In Group Project Group User Resource Value SystemAdmin CRUD CRUDP CRUDP all CRUDP all CRUDP all ProjectAdmin -RUD CRUDP CRUDP +/- project CRUDP (in project) CRUDP (in project) ProjectMember ---- ----- ----- CRUD- (in project) ----- (in project) Creator ---- ----- ----- -RUDP (his resource) ----- (his value) KnownUser C--- C---- CRUD- himself R---- (in project) R---- (in project) Default Permissions Matrix for new Projects Basic Workflows involving Permissions Creating a new Resource Accessing a Resource/Value Project / Group Administration Implementation The requirements for defining default permissions imposed by all the different use cases are very broad. Potentially, we need to be able to define default permissions per project, per group, per resource class, per resource property, and all their possible combinations. For this reason, we introduce the knora-admin:Permission class with two sub-classes, namely knora-admin:AdministrativePermission and knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission , which instances will carry all the necessary information. Permission Class Hierarchy and Structure The following graphs show the class hierarchy and the structure of each permission class. Permission Class Hierarchy Administrative Permission Structure : and the same as RDF: <http://rdfh.ch/permissions/[UUID]> rdf:type knora-admin:AdministrativePermission ; knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/[shortcode]> ; knora-admin:forGroup <http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]> ; knora-base:hasPermissions \"ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission| ProjectResourceCreateRestrictedPermission \"<Resource Class IRI>\"| ProjectAdminAllPermission| ProjectAdminGroupAllPermission| ProjectAdminGroupRestrictedPermission \"<http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]>, <http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]>\"| ProjectAdminRightsAllPermission| ProjectAdminOntologyAllPermission\"^^xsd:string .

Querying Permission Instances The properties forProject and either of forGroup , forResourceClass , and forProperty form together a compound key , allowing finding existing permission instances, that address the same set of Project / Group / ResourceClass / Property combination, thus making it possible to extend or change the attached permissions. Administrative Permission Instances : For each group inside the project, there can be zero or one instance holding administrative permission information. Querying is straitforward by using the knora-admin:forProject and knora-admin:forGroup properties as the compound key. Default Object Access Permission Instances : For each group, resource class, or property inside the project, there can be zero or one instances holding default object access permission informations. Querying is straitforward by using the knora-admin:forProject and either knora-admin:forGroup , knora-admin:forResourceClass , or knora-admin:forProperty properties as part of the compound key.

A the time the user's UserProfile is queried, all permissions for all projects and groups the user is a member of are also queried. This information is then stored as an easy accessible object inside the UserProfile , being readily available wherever needed. As this is a somewhat expensive operation, built-in caching mechanism at different levels (e.g., UsersResponder, PermissionsResponder), will be applied. Use Cases UC01: Teaching a Class Description : I'm teaching a class and I have the names and email addresses of all the students. I want to create a project, divide the students into groups (which will only be relevant to this project, e.g. one group for each section of the class), and put some students in each group. I don't want people to be able to join the project or the group by themselves. Solution : The teacher creates different groups and adds users to those groups. Additionally, the teacher can give TA's GroupAdmin privileges, and let the TA's add students to the different groups. UC02: Unibas Librarian Description : I'm a Unibas librarian managing several archiving projects. I need to give everyone at the university permission to view all these projects. I want to create a group called UnibasUser that everyone with a Unibas email address will automatically belong to. Most of the resources in those projects can then grant view permission to UnibasUser . Or perhaps the group will be SwitchUser , for anyone at a Swiss university. Or something even broader. Solution : These can be solved by creating Smart Groups , where the user can define what properties need to be set, so that an user is automatically part of this group. This will be implemented at a later time, as it is not trivial and should also include all special groups (e.g., KnownUser, ProjectMember, ProjectAdmin, etc.) that are currently hard-coded inside the system. UC03: Crowdsourcing Project Description : I'm doing a crowdsourcing project, which involves several different groups that work on different tasks. I'm hoping for thousands of users, and I'd like anyone to be able to join the project and add themselves to any group they want (as long as Knora verifies their email address), without needing approval from me. Solution : This can be solved by allowing self-assignment to a group. UC04: User \"left\" Knora Description : An user who was an active collaborator, decides to \"quit\", and wants to delete his user. Solution : The user's IRI is saved on each value change as part of the versioning mechanism. Exchanging the user's IRI in those places would count as 'rewriting history'. So deleting a user will not be possible, instead the user will be set as not active . Redesign / Questions June 2016 Permissions constrained to groups Why this constraint? This is just the way we are doing it. Makes it a bit simpler. Resource owner permission to disruptive knora-base:attachedToUser gives owner status to the person who created the resource. Proposed change: remove this altogether or make institution/project owner of the resource. Should hiwis be \"owners\" of resources they create on behalf of their professor? If the creator should have max permission, then give it explicitly. Owner will be renamed to creator. We need this for provenance. Does not give any permissions automatically. The permissions depend on what is defined for the project and the creator smart group. Resource creation permission to course being part of a projects gives resource creation permission.

Every group needs to belong to a project. No GroupAdmins. ProjectAdmins with additional GroupAdmin permissions. root Should the 'root' / SystemAdmin user have 'implicitly' or 'explicitly' all permissions? Has implicitly all permissions. Does the has all permissions also extend to projects? Is the root user going to be part of every project? If yes, then again implicitly or explicitly? Since 'root' / SystemAdmin already has all permissions, doesn't really matter if part of a project or group Ivan's Use Case The system administrator creates the project and sets Ivan as the project administrator. As the project administrator, I have all permissions on all objects (Resources/Values; Project Groups) belonging to the project (knora-base:attachedToProject). Nobody outside of the project should be allowed to see anything that is created as part of Ivan's project. He wants to be able to create two groups: Reviewer , Creator . The Reviewer group should only give read-access to someone inside the group to resources pointing to this group, but allow the creation of annotations. Further, annotations should only be readable by users inside the Reviewer group. The Creator group should give a user create permission and modify permission on the objects the user has created. Any resources created belong to the project. The Creator group is meant for contributors helping out with the project, e.g., Hiwis. Covered Lausanne Projects A project wants to restrict the permissions of newly created resources to a fixed set Covered.

This root user has the right to do anything. Knora\u2019s concept of access control is that permissions can only be granted to groups (or the whole project, i.e. all members of a project) and not to individual users. There are two distinct ways of granting permission. Firstly, an object (a resource or value) can grant permissions to groups of users, and secondly, permissions can be granted directly to a group of users (not bound to a specific object). There are six built-in groups: UnknownUser , KnownUser , Creator , ProjectMember , ProjectAdmin , and SystemAdmin . These groups can be used in the same way as normal user created groups for permission management, i.e. can be used to give certain groups of users, certain permissions, without the need to explicitly create them. A user becomes implicitly a member of such a group by satisfying certain conditions: knora-admin:UnknownUser : Any user who has not logged into Knora is automatically assigned to this group. knora-admin:KnownUser : Any user who has logged into Knora is automatically assigned to this group. knora-admin:Creator : When checking a user\u2019s permissions on an object, the user is automatically assigned to this group if he is the creator of the object. knora-admin:ProjectMember : When checking a user\u2019s permissions, the user is automatically assigned to this group by being a member of a project designated by the knora-admin:isInProject property. knora-admin:ProjectAdmin : When checking a user's permission, the user is automatically assigned to this group through the knora-admin:isInProjectAdminGroup property, which points to the project in question. knora-admin:SystemAdmin : Membership is received by setting the property knora-admin:isInSystemAdminGroup to true on a knora-admin:User . To use these build-in groups as values for properties (Object Access and Default Permissions), the IRI is constructed by appending the name of the built-in group to knora-admin , e.g., knora-admin:KnownUser where knora-admin corresponds to http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin# .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-admin/administration/#permissions","text":"Up until know, we have mentioned two groups of permissions.

View permission (V) : Allows an unrestricted view of the object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the user\u2019s ability to view information about the resource other than its values. To view a value, she must have view permission on the value itself. Modify permission (M) : For values, this permission allows a new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows the user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an existing value), or to change information about the resource other than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value, his permissions on the containing resource are not relevant. However, when he wants to change the target of a link, the old link must be deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify permission on the resource. Delete permission (D) : Allows the item to be marked as deleted. Change rights permission (CR) : Allows the permissions granted by the object to be changed. Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered permissions. A user\u2019s permission level on a particular object is calculated in the following way: Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including Creator and/or ProjectMember and/or ProjectAdmin if applicable. Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the object, by iterating over the permissions that the object grants. For each permission, if she is in the specified group, add the specified permission to the list of permissions she can obtain. From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission.

Every group needs to belong to a project. No GroupAdmins. ProjectAdmins with additional GroupAdmin permissions. root Should the 'root' / SystemAdmin user have 'implicitly' or 'explicitly' all permissions? Has implicitly all permissions. Does the has all permissions also extend to projects? Is the root user going to be part of every project? If yes, then again implicitly or explicitly? Since 'root' / SystemAdmin already has all permissions, doesn't really matter if part of a project or group Ivan's Use Case The system administrator creates the project and sets Ivan as the project administrator. As the project administrator, I have all permissions on all objects (Resources/Values; Project Groups) belonging to the project (knora-base:attachedToProject). Nobody outside of the project should be allowed to see anything that is created as part of Ivan's project. He wants to be able to create two groups: Reviewer , Creator . The Reviewer group should only give read-access to someone inside the group to resources pointing to this group, but allow the creation of annotations. Further, annotations should only be readable by users inside the Reviewer group. The Creator group should give a user create permission and modify permission on the objects the user has created. Any resources created belong to the project. The Creator group is meant for contributors helping out with the project, e.g., Hiwis. Covered Lausanne Projects A project wants to restrict the permissions of newly created resources to a fixed set Covered. Will be able do define 'default permissions' and restrict the creation of new resources to these permissions This means for the current implementation, that any permissions supplied during the resource creation request need to be checked and if needed overriden. Covered. Also in the new design, the backend will need to always check the suplied permissions for newly created resources as we cannot ve sure that the GUI will behave correctly (e.g., many different \"Salsah\" implementations) Restrict creation/access of certain classes of resources to certain groups, e.g., group A is able to create/access resources of class A but not of class B. Covered. Will be able to give a certain group only create permission for specific classes Results Owner renamed to Creator Some permissions are attached to groups (e.g., Add Resource (Class), Modify Ontology, etc.), and some are attached to resources (e.g., this group has read/modify permission, etc.) Ontologien Benutzung einschr\u00e4nken (nur auf bestimmte Gruppen, oder frei zur Verf\u00fcgung) System Admin Rechte implizit Gruppen immer an Projekt gebunden Keine Gruppen-Admins.

For each type, there is a case class that represents the lowest common denominator of the type, the data that will be present regardless of the API operation.

Type Inspection The code that converts Gravserch queries into SPARQL queries, and processes the query results, needs to know the types of the entities that are used in the input query. As explained in Type Inference , these types can be inferred, or they can be specified in the query using type annotations. Type inspection is implemented in the package org.knora.webapi.messages.util.search.gravsearch.types . The entry point to this package is GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner , which is instantiated by SearchResponderV2 . The result of type inspection is a GravsearchTypeInspectionResult , in which each typeable entity in the input query is associated with a GravsearchEntityTypeInfo , which can be either: A PropertyTypeInfo , which specifies the type of object that a property is expected to have. A NonPropertyTypeInfo , which specifies the type of a variable, or the type of an IRI representing a resource or value. Identifying Typeable Entities After parsing a Gravsearch query, SearchResponderV2 calls GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner.inspectTypes , passing the WHERE clause of the input query. This method first identifies the entities whose types need to be determined. Each of these entities is represented as a TypeableEntity . To do this, GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner uses QueryTraverser to traverse the WHERE clause, collecting typeable entities in a visitor called TypeableEntityCollectingWhereVisitor . The entities that are considered to need type information are: All variables. All IRIs except for those that represent type annotations or types. The Type Inspection Pipeline GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner contains a pipeline of type inspectors, each of which extends GravsearchTypeInspector . There are two type inspectors in the pipeline: AnnotationReadingGravsearchTypeInspector : reads type annotations included in a Gravsearch query. InferringGravsearchTypeInspector : infers the types of entities from the context in which they are used, as well as from ontology information that it requests from OntologyResponderV2 . Each type inspector takes as input, and returns as output, an IntermediateTypeInspectionResult , which associates each TypeableEntity with zero or more types. Initially, each TypeableEntity has no types. Each type inspector adds whatever types it finds for each entity. At the end of the pipeline, each entity should have exactly one type. Therefore, to only keep the most specific type for an entity, the method refineDeterminedTypes refines the determined types by removing those that are base classes of others. However, it can be that inconsistent types are determined for entities. For example, in cases where multiple resource class types are determined, but one is not a base class of the others. From the following statement { ?document a beol:manuscript . } UNION { ?document a beol:letter .} two inconsistent types can be inferred for ?document : beol:letter and beol:manuscript . In these cases, a sanitizer sanitizeInconsistentResourceTypes replaces the inconsistent resource types by their common base resource class (in the above example, it would be beol:writtenSource ). Lastly, an error is returned if An entity's type could not be determined. The client must add a type annotation to make the query work. Inconsistent types could not be sanitized (an entity appears to have more than one type). The client must correct the query. If there are no errors, GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner converts the pipeline's output to a GravsearchTypeInspectionResult , in which each entity is associated with exactly one type. AnnotationReadingGravsearchTypeInspector This inspector uses QueryTraverser to traverse the WHERE clause, collecting type annotations in a visitor called AnnotationCollectingWhereVisitor . It then converts each annotation to a GravsearchEntityTypeInfo . InferringGravsearchTypeInspector This inspector first uses QueryTraverser to traverse the WHERE clause, assembling an index of usage information about typeable entities in a visitor called UsageIndexCollectingWhereVisitor . The UsageIndex contains, for example, an index of all the entities that are used as subjects, predicates, or objects, along with the statements in which they are used. It also contains sets of all the Knora class and property IRIs that are used in the WHERE clause. InferringGravsearchTypeInspector then asks OntologyResponderV2 for information about those classes and properties, as well as about the classes that are subject types or object types of those properties. Next, the inspector runs inference rules (which extend InferenceRule ) on each TypeableEntity . Each rule takes as input a TypeableEntity , the usage index, the ontology information, and the IntermediateTypeInspectionResult , and returns a new IntermediateTypeInspectionResult . For example, TypeOfObjectFromPropertyRule infers an entity's type if the entity is used as the object of a statement and the predicate's knora-api:objectType is known. For each TypeableEntity , if a type is inferred from a property, the entity and the inferred type are added to IntermediateTypeInspectionResult.entitiesInferredFromProperty . The inference rules are run repeatedly, because the output of one rule may allow another rule to infer additional information. There are two pipelines of rules: a pipeline for the first iteration of type inference, and a pipeline for subsequent iterations. This is because some rules can return additional information if they are run more than once on the same entity, while others cannot. The number of iterations is limited to InferringGravsearchTypeInspector.MAX_ITERATIONS , but in practice two iterations are sufficient for most realistic queries, and it is difficult to design a query that requires more than six iterations. Transformation of a Gravsearch Query A Gravsearch query submitted by the client is parsed by GravsearchParser and preprocessed by GravsearchTypeInspector to get type information about the elements used in the query (resources, values, properties etc.) and do some basic sanity checks. In SearchResponderV2 , two queries are generated from a given Gravsearch query: a prequery and a main query. Query Transformers The Gravsearch query is passed to QueryTraverser along with a query transformer. Query transformers are classes that implement traits supported by QueryTraverser : WhereTransformer : instructions how to convert statements in the WHERE clause of a SPARQL query (to generate the prequery's Where clause). To improve query performance, this trait defines the method optimiseQueryPatterns whose implementation can call private methods to optimise the generated SPARQL. For example, before transformation of statements in WHERE clause, query pattern orders must be optimised by moving LuceneQueryPatterns to the beginning and isDeleted statement patterns to the end of the WHERE clause. ConstructToSelectTransformer (extends WhereTransformer ): instructions how to turn a Construct query into a Select query (converts a Gravsearch query into a prequery) SelectToSelectTransformer (extends WhereTransformer ): instructions how to turn a triplestore independent Select query into a triplestore dependent Select query (implementation of inference). ConstructToConstructTransformer (extends WhereTransformer ): instructions how to turn a triplestore independent Construct query into a triplestore dependent Construct query (implementation of inference). The traits listed above define methods that are implemented in the transformer classes and called by QueryTraverser to perform SPARQL to SPARQL conversions. When iterating over the statements of the input query, the transformer class's transformation methods are called to perform the conversion. Prequery The purpose of the prequery is to get an ordered collection of results representing only the IRIs of one page of matching resources and values. Sort criteria can be submitted by the user, but the result is always deterministic also without sort criteria. This is necessary to support paging. A prequery is a SPARQL SELECT query. The classes involved in generating prequeries can be found in org.knora.webapi.messages.util.search.gravsearch.prequery . If the client submits a count query, the prequery returns the overall number of hits, but not the results themselves. In a first step, before transforming the WHERE clause, query patterns must be further optimised by removing the rdfs:type statement for entities whose type could be inferred from their use with a property IRI, since there would be no need for explicit rdfs:type statements for them (unless the property IRI from which the type of an entity must be inferred from is wrapped in an OPTIONAL block). This optimisation takes the Gravsearch query as input (rather than the generated SPARQL), because it uses type information that refers to entities in the Gravsearch query, and the generated SPARQL might have different entities. Next, the Gravsearch query's WHERE clause is transformed and the prequery (SELECT and WHERE clause) is generated from this result. The transformation of the Gravsearch query's WHERE clause relies on the implementation of the abstract class AbstractPrequeryGenerator . AbstractPrequeryGenerator contains members whose state is changed during the iteration over the statements of the input query. They can then by used to create the converted query. mainResourceVariable: Option[QueryVariable] : SPARQL variable representing the main resource of the input query. Present in the prequery's SELECT clause. dependentResourceVariables: mutable.Set[QueryVariable] : a set of SPARQL variables representing dependent resources in the input query. Used in an aggregation function in the prequery's SELECT clause (see below). dependentResourceVariablesGroupConcat: Set[QueryVariable] : a set of SPARQL variables representing an aggregation of dependent resources. Present in the prequery's SELECT clause. valueObjectVariables: mutable.Set[QueryVariable] : a set of SPARQL variables representing value objects. Used in an aggregation function in the prequery's SELECT clause (see below). valueObjectVarsGroupConcat: Set[QueryVariable] : a set of SPARQL variables representing an aggregation of value objects. Present in the prequery's SELECT clause. The variables mentioned above are present in the prequery's result rows because they are part of the prequery's SELECT clause. The following example illustrates the handling of variables. The following Gravsearch query looks for pages with a sequence number of 10 that are part of a book: PREFIX incunabula: <http://0.0.0.0:3333/ontology/0803/incunabula/simple/v2#> PREFIX knora-api: <http://api.knora.org/ontology/knora-api/simple/v2#> CONSTRUCT { ?page knora-api:isMainResource true . ?page knora-api:isPartOf ?book . ?page incunabula:seqnum ?seqnum . } WHERE { ?page a incunabula:page . ?page knora-api:isPartOf ?book . ?book a incunabula:book . ?page incunabula:seqnum ?seqnum . FILTER(?seqnum = 10) } The prequery's SELECT clause is built by NonTriplestoreSpecificGravsearchToPrequeryTransformer.getSelectColumns , based on the variables used in the input query's CONSTRUCT clause. The resulting SELECT clause looks as follows: SELECT DISTINCT ?page (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(IF(BOUND(?book), STR(?book), \"\")); SEPARATOR='') AS ?book__Concat) (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(IF(BOUND(?seqnum), STR(?seqnum), \"\")); SEPARATOR='') AS ?seqnum__Concat) (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(IF(BOUND(?book__LinkValue), STR(?book__LinkValue), \"\")); SEPARATOR='') AS ?book__LinkValue__Concat) WHERE {...} GROUP BY ?page ORDER BY ASC(?page) LIMIT 25 ?page represents the main resource. When accessing the prequery's result rows, ?page contains the IRI of the main resource. The prequery's results are grouped by the main resource so that there is exactly one result row per matching main resource. ?page is also used as a sort criterion although none has been defined in the input query. This is necessary to make paging work: results always have to be returned in the same order (the prequery is always deterministic). Like this, results can be fetched page by page using LIMIT and OFFSET. Grouping by main resource requires other results to be aggregated using the function GROUP_CONCAT . ?book is used as an argument of the aggregation function. The aggregation's result is accessible in the prequery's result rows as ?book__Concat . The variable ?book is bound to an IRI. Since more than one IRI could be bound to a variable representing a dependent resource, the results have to be aggregated. GROUP_CONCAT takes two arguments: a collection of strings (IRIs in our use case) and a separator (we use the non-printing Unicode character INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE ). When accessing ?book__Concat in the prequery's results containing the IRIs of dependent resources, the string has to be split with the separator used in the aggregation function. The result is a collection of IRIs representing dependent resources. The same logic applies to value objects. Each GROUP_CONCAT checks whether the concatenated variable is bound in each result in the group; if a variable is unbound, we concatenate an empty string. This is necessary because, in Apache Jena (and perhaps other triplestores), \"If GROUP_CONCAT has an unbound value in the list of values to concat, the overall result is 'error'\" (see this Jena issue ). If the input query contains a UNION , and a variable is bound in one branch of the UNION and not in another branch, it is possible that the prequery will return more than one row per main resource. To deal with this situation, SearchResponderV2 merges rows that contain the same main resource IRI. Main Query The purpose of the main query is to get all requested information about the main resource, dependent resources, and value objects. The IRIs of those resources and value objects were returned by the prequery. Since the prequery only returns resources and value objects matching the input query's criteria, the main query can specifically ask for more detailed information on these resources and values without having to reconsider these criteria. Generating the Main Query The classes involved in generating the main query can be found in org.knora.webapi.messages.util.search.gravsearch.mainquery . The main query is a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query. Its generation is handled by the method GravsearchMainQueryGenerator.createMainQuery . It takes three arguments: mainResourceIris: Set[IriRef], dependentResourceIris: Set[IriRef], valueObjectIris: Set[IRI] . These sets are constructed based on information about variables representing dependent resources and value objects in the prequery, which is provided by NonTriplestoreSpecificGravsearchToPrequeryTransformer : dependentResourceVariablesGroupConcat : Set(QueryVariable(book__Concat)) valueObjectVariablesGroupConcat : Set(QueryVariable(seqnum__Concat), QueryVariable(book__LinkValue__Concat)) From the given Iris, statements are generated that ask for complete information on exactly these resources and values. For any given resource Iri, only the values present in valueObjectIris are to be queried. This is achieved by using SPARQL's VALUES expression for the main resource and dependent resources as well as for values. Processing the Main Query's results To do the permission checking, the results of the main query are passed to ConstructResponseUtilV2.splitMainResourcesAndValueRdfData , which transforms a SparqlConstructResponse (a set of RDF triples) into a structure organized by main resource Iris. In this structure, dependent resources and values are nested and can be accessed via their main resource, and resources and values that the user does not have permission to see are filtered out. As a result, a page of results may contain fewer than the maximum allowed number of results per page, even if more pages of results are available. MainQueryResultProcessor.getRequestedValuesFromResultsWithFullGraphPattern then filters out values that the user did not explicitly ask for in the input query. Finally, ConstructResponseUtilV2.createApiResponse transforms the query results into an API response (a ReadResourcesSequenceV2 ). If the number of main resources found (even if filtered out because of permissions) is equal to the maximum allowed page size, the predicate knora-api:mayHaveMoreResults: true is included in the response. Inference Gravsearch queries support a subset of RDFS reasoning (see Inference in the API documentation on Gravsearch). This is implemented as follows: When the non-triplestore-specific version of a SPARQL query is generated, statements that do not need inference are marked with the virtual named graph <http://www.knora.org/explicit> . When the triplestore-specific version of the query is generated: If the triplestore is GraphDB, SparqlTransformer.transformKnoraExplicitToGraphDBExplicit changes statements with the virtual graph <http://www.knora.org/explicit> so that they are marked with the GraphDB-specific graph <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit> , and leaves other statements unchanged. SparqlTransformer.transformKnoraExplicitToGraphDBExplicit also adds the valueHasString statements which GraphDB needs for text searches. If Knora is not using the triplestore's inference (e.g. with Fuseki), SparqlTransformer.transformStatementInWhereForNoInference removes <http://www.knora.org/explicit> , and expands unmarked statements using rdfs:subClassOf* and rdfs:subPropertyOf* . Gravsearch also provides some virtual properties, which take advantage of forward-chaining inference as an optimisation if the triplestore provides it. For example, the virtual property knora-api:standoffTagHasStartAncestor is equivalent to knora-base:standoffTagHasStartParent* , but with GraphDB it is implemented using a custom inference rule (in KnoraRules.pie ) and is therefore more efficient. If Knora is not using the triplestore's inference, SparqlTransformer.transformStatementInWhereForNoInference replaces knora-api:standoffTagHasStartAncestor with knora-base:standoffTagHasStartParent* . Optimisation of generated SPARQL The triplestore-specific transformers in SparqlTransformer.scala can run optimisations on the generated SPARQL, in the method optimiseQueryPatterns inherited from WhereTransformer . For example, moveLuceneToBeginning moves Lucene queries to the beginning of the block in which they occur.","title":"Gravsearch Design"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/gravsearch/#gravsearch-design","text":"","title":"Gravsearch Design"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/gravsearch/#gravsearch-package","text":"The classes that process Gravsearch queries and results can be found in org.knora.webapi.messages.util.search.gravsearch .","title":"Gravsearch Package"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/gravsearch/#type-inspection","text":"The code that converts Gravserch queries into SPARQL queries, and processes the query results, needs to know the types of the entities that are used in the input query.

Type inspection is implemented in the package org.knora.webapi.messages.util.search.gravsearch.types . The entry point to this package is GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner , which is instantiated by SearchResponderV2 . The result of type inspection is a GravsearchTypeInspectionResult , in which each typeable entity in the input query is associated with a GravsearchEntityTypeInfo , which can be either: A PropertyTypeInfo , which specifies the type of object that a property is expected to have.

There are two type inspectors in the pipeline: AnnotationReadingGravsearchTypeInspector : reads type annotations included in a Gravsearch query. InferringGravsearchTypeInspector : infers the types of entities from the context in which they are used, as well as from ontology information that it requests from OntologyResponderV2 . Each type inspector takes as input, and returns as output, an IntermediateTypeInspectionResult , which associates each TypeableEntity with zero or more types. Initially, each TypeableEntity has no types. Each type inspector adds whatever types it finds for each entity. At the end of the pipeline, each entity should have exactly one type. Therefore, to only keep the most specific type for an entity, the method refineDeterminedTypes refines the determined types by removing those that are base classes of others. However, it can be that inconsistent types are determined for entities. For example, in cases where multiple resource class types are determined, but one is not a base class of the others. From the following statement { ?document a beol:manuscript . } UNION { ?document a beol:letter .} two inconsistent types can be inferred for ?document : beol:letter and beol:manuscript . In these cases, a sanitizer sanitizeInconsistentResourceTypes replaces the inconsistent resource types by their common base resource class (in the above example, it would be beol:writtenSource ). Lastly, an error is returned if An entity's type could not be determined. The client must add a type annotation to make the query work. Inconsistent types could not be sanitized (an entity appears to have more than one type). The client must correct the query. If there are no errors, GravsearchTypeInspectionRunner converts the pipeline's output to a GravsearchTypeInspectionResult , in which each entity is associated with exactly one type.","title":"The Type Inspection Pipeline"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/gravsearch/#annotationreadinggravsearchtypeinspector","text":"This inspector uses QueryTraverser to traverse the WHERE clause, collecting type annotations in a visitor called AnnotationCollectingWhereVisitor .

It also contains sets of all the Knora class and property IRIs that are used in the WHERE clause. InferringGravsearchTypeInspector then asks OntologyResponderV2 for information about those classes and properties, as well as about the classes that are subject types or object types of those properties. Next, the inspector runs inference rules (which extend InferenceRule ) on each TypeableEntity . Each rule takes as input a TypeableEntity , the usage index, the ontology information, and the IntermediateTypeInspectionResult , and returns a new IntermediateTypeInspectionResult . For example, TypeOfObjectFromPropertyRule infers an entity's type if the entity is used as the object of a statement and the predicate's knora-api:objectType is known. For each TypeableEntity , if a type is inferred from a property, the entity and the inferred type are added to IntermediateTypeInspectionResult.entitiesInferredFromProperty . The inference rules are run repeatedly, because the output of one rule may allow another rule to infer additional information. There are two pipelines of rules: a pipeline for the first iteration of type inference, and a pipeline for subsequent iterations. This is because some rules can return additional information if they are run more than once on the same entity, while others cannot. The number of iterations is limited to InferringGravsearchTypeInspector.MAX_ITERATIONS , but in practice two iterations are sufficient for most realistic queries, and it is difficult to design a query that requires more than six iterations.","title":"InferringGravsearchTypeInspector"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/gravsearch/#transformation-of-a-gravsearch-query","text":"A Gravsearch query submitted by the client is parsed by GravsearchParser and preprocessed by GravsearchTypeInspector to get type information about the elements used in the query (resources, values, properties etc.) and do some basic sanity checks.

These classes provide commonly needed functionality for extracting and validating data from JSON-LD documents, as well as for constructing new documents. Parsing JSON-LD A route that expects a JSON-LD request must first parse the JSON-LD using JsonLDUtil . For example, this is how ValuesRouteV2 parses a JSON-LD request to create a value: post { entity(as[String]) { jsonRequest => requestContext => { val requestDoc: JsonLDDocument = JsonLDUtil.parseJsonLD(jsonRequest) The result is a JsonLDDocument in which all prefixes have been expanded to full IRIs, with an empty JSON-LD context. The next step is to convert the JsonLDDocument to a request message that can be sent to the Knora responder that will handle the request. val requestMessageFuture: Future[CreateValueRequestV2] = for { requestingUser <- getUserADM(requestContext) requestMessage: CreateValueRequestV2 <- CreateValueRequestV2.fromJsonLD( requestDoc, apiRequestID = UUID.randomUUID, requestingUser = requestingUser, responderManager = responderManager, storeManager = storeManager, settings = settings, log = log ) } yield requestMessage This is done in a Future , because the processing of JSON-LD input could in itself involve sending messages to responders.

The fromJsonLD method can use the functionality of the JsonLDDocument data structure for extracting and validating the content of the request. For example, JsonLDObject.requireStringWithValidation gets a required member of a JSON-LD object, and validates it using a function that is passed as an argument. Here is an example of getting and validating a SmartIri : for { valueType: SmartIri <- Future(jsonLDObject.requireStringWithValidation(JsonLDConstants.TYPE, stringFormatter.toSmartIriWithErr)) The validation function (in this case stringFormatter.toSmartIriWithErr ) has to take two arguments: a string to be validated, and a function that that throws an exception if the string is invalid. The return value of requireStringWithValidation is the return value of the validation function, which in this case is a SmartIri . If the string is invalid, requireStringWithValidation throws BadRequestException . It is also possible to get and validate an optional JSON-LD object member: val maybeDateValueHasStartEra: Option[DateEraV2] = jsonLDObject.maybeStringWithValidation(OntologyConstants.KnoraApiV2Complex.DateValueHasStartEra, DateEraV2.parse) Here JsonLDObject.maybeStringWithValidation returns an Option that contains the return value of the validation function ( DateEraV2.parse ) if it was given, otherwise None . Returning a JSON-LD Response Each API response is represented by a message class that extends KnoraResponseV2 , which has a method toJsonLDDocument that specifies the target ontology schema: /** * * A trait for Knora API V2 response messages. Any response can be converted into JSON-LD. * */ trait KnoraResponseV2 { /** * Converts the response to a data structure that can be used to generate JSON-LD. * * @param targetSchema the Knora API schema to be used in the JSON-LD document. * @return a [[JsonLDDocument]] representing the response. */ def toJsonLDDocument(targetSchema: ApiV2Schema, settings: KnoraSettingsImpl, schemaOptions: Set[SchemaOption]): JsonLDDocument } The implementation of this method constructs a JsonLDDocument , in which all object keys are full IRIs (no prefixes are used), but in which the JSON-LD context also specifies the prefixes that will be used when the document is returned to the client. The function JsonLDUtil.makeContext is a convenient way to construct the JSON-LD context. Since toJsonLDDocument has to return an object that uses the specified ontology schema, the recommended design is to separate schema conversion as much as possible from JSON-LD generation. As a first step, schema conversion (or at the very least, the conversion of Knora type IRIs to the target schema) can be done via an implementation of KnoraReadV2 : /** * A trait for read wrappers that can convert themselves to external schemas. * * @tparam C the type of the read wrapper that extends this trait. */ trait KnoraReadV2[C <: KnoraReadV2[C]] { this: C => def toOntologySchema(targetSchema: ApiV2Schema): C } This means that the response message class has the method toOntologySchema , which returns a copy of the same message, with Knora type IRIs (and perhaps other content) adjusted for the target schema. (See Smart IRIs on how to convert Knora type IRIs to the target schema.) The response message class could then have a private method called generateJsonLD , which generates a JsonLDDocument that has the correct structure for the target schema, like this: private def generateJsonLD(targetSchema: ApiV2Schema, settings: KnoraSettingsImpl, schemaOptions: Set[SchemaOption]): JsonLDDocument This way, the implementation of toJsonLDDocument can call toOntologySchema , then construct a JsonLDDocument from the resulting object. For example: override def toJsonLDDocument(targetSchema: ApiV2Schema, settings: KnoraSettingsImpl, schemaOptions: Set[SchemaOption] = Set.empty): JsonLDDocument = { toOntologySchema(targetSchema).generateJsonLD( targetSchema = targetSchema, settings = settings, schemaOptions = schemaOptions ) } Selecting the Response Schema Most routes complete by calling RouteUtilV2.runRdfRouteWithFuture , which calls the response message's toJsonLDDocument method. The runRdfRouteWithFuture function has a parameter that enables the route to select the schema that should be used in the response. It is up to each route to determine what the appropriate response schema should be. Some routes support only one response schema. Others allow the client to choose. To use the schema requested by the client, the route can call RouteUtilV2.getOntologySchema : RouteUtilV2.runRdfRouteWithFuture( requestMessageF = requestMessageFuture, requestContext = requestContext, settings = settings, responderManager = responderManager, log = log, targetSchema = targetSchema, schemaOptions = schemaOptions ) If the route only supports one schema, it can specify the schema directly instead: RouteUtilV2.runRdfRouteWithFuture( requestMessageF = requestMessageFuture, requestContext = requestContext, settings = settings, responderManager = responderManager, log = log, targetSchema = ApiV2Complex, schemaOptions = RouteUtilV2.getSchemaOptions(requestContext) ) Generating Other RDF Formats RouteUtilV2.runRdfRouteWithFuture implements HTTP content negotiation , and converts JSON-LD responses into Turtle or RDF/XML as appropriate.","title":"JSON-LD Parsing and Formatting"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/json-ld/#json-ld-parsing-and-formatting","text":"","title":"JSON-LD Parsing and Formatting"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/json-ld/#jsonldutil","text":"Knora provides a utility object called JsonLDUtil , which wraps the titanium-json-ld Java library , and parses JSON-LD text to a Knora data structure called JsonLDDocument .

Any API v2 response can be returned as JSON-LD , Turtle , or RDF/XML . Each class or property used in a request or response has a definition in an ontology, which Knora can serve. Response formats are reused for different requests whenever possible, to minimise the number of different response formats a client has to handle. For example, any request for one or more resources (such as a search result, or a request for one specific resource) returns a response in the same format. Response size is limited by design. Large amounts of data must be retrieved by requesting small pages of data, one after the other. Responses that provide data are distinct from responses that provide definitions (i.e. ontology entities). Data responses indicate which types are used, and the client can request information about these types separately. API Schemas The types used in the triplestore are not exposed directly in the API. Instead, they are mapped onto API 'schemas'. Two schemas are currently provided. A complex schema, which is suitable both for reading and for editing data. The complex schema represents values primarily as complex objects. A simple schema, which is suitable for reading data but not for editing it. The simple schema facilitates interoperability between Knora ontologies and non-Knora ontologies, since it represents values primarily as literals. Each schema has its own type IRIs, which are derived from the ones used in the triplestore. For details of these different IRI formats, see Knora IRIs . Implementation JSON-LD Parsing and Formatting Each API response is represented by a class that extends KnoraResponseV2 , which has a method toJsonLDDocument that specifies the target schema. It is currently up to each route to determine what the appropriate response schema should be. Some routes will support only one response schema. Others will allow the client to choose, and there will be one or more standard ways for the client to specify the desired response schema. A route calls RouteUtilV2.runRdfRoute , passing a request message and a response schema. When RouteUtilV2 gets the response message from the responder, it calls toJsonLDDocument on it, specifying that schema. The response message returns a JsonLDDocument , which is a simple data structure that is then converted to Java objects and passed to the JSON-LD Java library for formatting. In general, toJsonLDDocument is implemented in two stages: first the object converts itself to the target schema, and then the resulting object is converted to a JsonLDDocument . A route that receives JSON-LD requests should use JsonLDUtil.parseJsonLD to convert each request to a JsonLDDocument . Generation of Other RDF Formats RouteUtilV2.runRdfRoute implements HTTP content negotiation , and converts JSON-LD responses into Turtle or RDF/XML as appropriate. Operation Wrappers Whenever possible, the same data structures are used for input and output. Often more data is available in output than in input. For example, when a value is read from the triplestore, its IRI is available, but when it is being created, it does not yet have an IRI. In such cases, there is a class like ValueContentV2 , which represents the data that is used both for input and for output. When a value is read, a ValueContentV2 is wrapped in a ReadValueV2 , which additionally contains the value's IRI. When a value is created, it is wrapped in a CreateValueV2 , which has the resource IRI and the property IRI, but not the value IRI. A Read* wrapper can be wrapped in another Read* wrapper; for example, a ReadResourceV2 contains ReadValueV2 objects. Each *Content* class should extend KnoraContentV2 and thus have a toOntologySchema method or converting itself between internal and external schemas, in either direction. Each Read* wrapper class should have a method for converting itself to JSON-LD in a particular external schema. If the Read* wrapper is a KnoraResponseV2 , this method is toJsonLDDocument . Smart IRIs Usage The SmartIri trait can be used to parse and validate IRIs, and in particular for converting Knora type IRIs between internal and external schemas. It validates each IRI it parses. To use it, import the following: import org.knora.webapi.messages.{SmartIri, StringFormatter} import org.knora.webapi.messages.IriConversions._ Ensure that an implicit instance of StringFormatter is in scope: implicit val stringFormatter: StringFormatter = StringFormatter.getGeneralInstance Then, if iriStr is a string representing an IRI, you can can convert it to a SmartIri like this: val iri: SmartIri = iriStr.toSmartIri If the IRI came from a request, use this method to throw a specific exception if the IRI is invalid: val iri: SmartIri = iriStr.toSmartIriWithErr( () => throw BadRequestException(s\"Invalid IRI: $iriStr\") ) You can then use methods such as SmartIri.isKnoraApiV2EntityIri and SmartIri.getProjectCode to obtain information about the IRI. To convert it to another schema, call SmartIri.toOntologySchema . Converting a non-Knora IRI returns the same IRI. If the IRI represents a Knora internal value class such as knora-base:TextValue , converting it to the ApiV2Simple schema will return the corresponding simplified type, such as xsd:string . But this conversion is not performed in the other direction (external to internal), since this would require knowledge of the context in which the IRI is being used. The performance penalty for using a SmartIri instead of a string is very small. Instances are automatically cached once they are constructed. Parsing and caching a SmartIri instance takes about 10-20 \u00b5s, and retrieving a cached SmartIri takes about 1 \u00b5s. There is no advantage to using SmartIri for data IRIs, since they are not schema-specific (and are not cached). If a data IRI has been received from a client request, it is better just to validate it using StringFormatter.validateAndEscapeIri . Implementation The smart IRI implementation, SmartIriImpl , is nested in the StringFormatter class, because it uses Knora's hostname, which isn't available until the Akka ActorSystem has started. However, this means that the type of a SmartIriImpl instance is dependent on the instance of StringFormatter that constructed it. Therefore, instances of SmartIriImpl created by different instances of StringFormatter can't be compared directly. There are in fact two instances of StringFormatter : one returned by StringFormatter.getGeneralInstance which is available after Akka has started and has the API server's hostname (and can therefore provide SmartIri instances capable of parsing IRIs containing that hostname). This instance is used throughout the Knora API server. one returned by StringFormatter.getInstanceForConstantOntologies , which is available before Akka has started, and is used only by the hard-coded constant knora-api ontologies. This is the reason for the existence of the SmartIri trait, which is a top-level definition and has its own equals and hashCode methods. Instances of SmartIri can thus be compared (e.g. to use them as unique keys in collections), regardless of which instance of StringFormatter created them.","title":"API v2 Design Overview"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/overview/#api-v2-design-overview","text":"","title":"API v2 Design Overview"},{"location":"05-internals/design/api-v2/overview/#general-principles","text":"Knora API v2 requests and responses are RDF documents.

For example, any request for one or more resources (such as a search result, or a request for one specific resource) returns a response in the same format. Response size is limited by design. Large amounts of data must be retrieved by requesting small pages of data, one after the other.

In particular, Knora's SPARQL queries currently need to do the following: Given a base property, find triples using a subproperty as predicate, and return the subproperty used in each case. Given a base class, find triples using an instance of subclass as subject or object, and return the subclass used in each case. Without inference, this can be done using property path syntax. CONSTRUCT { ?resource a ?resourceClass . ?resource ?resourceValueProperty ?valueObject. WHERE { ?resource a ?resourceClass . ?resourceType rdfs:subClassOf* knora-base:Resource . ?resource ?resourceValueProperty ?valueObject . ?resourceValueProperty rdfs:subPropertyOf* knora-base:hasValue . This query: Checks that the queried resource belongs to a subclass of knora-base:Resource . Returns the class that the resource explicitly belongs to. Finds the Knora values attached to the resource, and returns each value along with the property that explicitly attaches it to the resource. In some triplestores, it can be more efficient to use RDFS inference than to use property path syntax, depending on how inference is implemented. For example, Ontotext GraphDB does inference when data is inserted, and stores inferred triples in the repository ( forward chaining with full materialisation ). Moreover, it provides a way of choosing whether to return explicit or inferred triples. This allows the query above to be optimised as follows, querying inferred triples but returning explicit triples: CONSTRUCT { ?resource a ?resourceClass . ?resource ?resourceValueProperty ?valueObject. WHERE { ?resource a knora-base:Resource . # inferred triple GRAPH <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit> { ?resource a ?resourceClass . # explicit triple } ?resource knora-base:hasValue ?valueObject . # inferred triple GRAPH <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit> { ?resource ?resourceValueProperty ?valueObject . # explicit triple } By querying inferred triples that are already stored in the repository, the optimised query avoids property path syntax and is therefore more efficient, while still only returning explicit triples in the query result. Other triplestores use a backward-chaining inference strategy, meaning that inference is performed during the execution of a SPARQL query, by expanding the query itself. The expanded query is likely to look like the first example, using property path syntax, and therefore it is not likely to be more efficient. Moreover, other triplestores may not provide a way to return explicit rather than inferred triples. To support such a triplestore, Knora uses property path syntax rather than inference. See the Gravsearch design documentation for information on how this is done for Gravsearch queries. The support for Apache Jena Fuseki currently works in this way. However, Fuseki supports both forward-chaining and backward-chaining rule engines, although it does not seem to have anything like GraphDB's <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit> . It would be worth exploring whether Knora's query result processing could be changed so that it could use forward-chaining inference as an optimisation, even if nothing like <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit> is available. For example, the example query= could be written like this: CONSTRUCT { ?resource a ?resourceClass . ?resource ?resourceValueProperty ?valueObject . WHERE { ?resource a knora-base:Resource . ?resource a ?resourceClass . ?resource knora-base:hasValue ?valueObject . ?resource ?resourceValueProperty ?valueObject . This would return inferred triples as well as explicit ones: a triple for each base class of the explicit ?resourceClass , and a triple for each base property of the explicit ?resourceValueProperty . But since Knora knows the class and property inheritance hierarchies, it could ignore the additional triples. Querying Past Value Versions Value versions are a linked list, starting with the current version. Each value points to the previous version via knora-base:previousValue . The resource points only to the current version. Past value versions are queried in getResourcePropertiesAndValues.scala.txt , which can take a timestamp argument.

Next, out of this set of versions, we exclude all versions except for the most recent one.

If it encounters an error, it returns SipiException . The Image File Upload Workflow The client uploads an image file to the upload route, which runs upload.lua . The image is converted to JPEG 2000 and stored in Sipi's tmp directory. In the response, the client receives the JPEG 2000's unique, randomly generated filename. The client submits a JSON-LD request to a Knora route ( /v2/values or /v2/resources ) to create or change a file value. The request includes Sipi's internal filename. During parsing of this JSON-LD request, a StillImageFileValueContentV2 is constructed to represent the file value. During the construction of this object, a GetFileMetadataRequestV2 is sent to SipiConnector , which uses Sipi's built-in knora.json route to get the rest of the file's metadata. A responder ( ResourcesResponderV2 or ValuesResponderV2 ) validates the request and updates the triplestore. (If it is ResourcesResponderV2 , it asks ValuesResponderV2 to generate SPARQL for the values.) The responder that did the update calls ValueUtilV2.doSipiPostUpdate .

If the request to Knora cannot be parsed, the temporary file is not deleted immediately, but it will be deleted during the processing of a subsequent request by Sipi's upload route. If Sipi's store route fails, Knora returns the SipiException to the client. In this case, manual intervention may be necessary to restore consistency between Knora and Sipi. If Sipi's delete_temp_file route fails, the error is not returned to the client, because there is already a Knora error that needs to be returned to the client.

However, it is also useful to enforce consistency constraints in the triplestore itself, for two reasons: To prevent inconsistencies resulting from bugs in the Knora API server. To prevent users from inserting inconsistent data directly into the triplestore, bypassing Knora. The design of the knora-base ontology supports two ways of specifying constraints on data (see knora-base: Consistency Checking for details): A property definition should specify the types that are allowed as subjects and objects of the property, using knora-base:subjectClassConstraint and (if it is an object property) knora-base:objectClassConstraint . Every subproperty of knora-base:hasValue or a knora-base:hasLinkTo (i.e. every property of a resource that points to a knora-base:Value or to another resource) is required have this constraint, because the Knora API server relies on it to know what type of object to expect for the property. Use of knora-base:subjectClassConstraint is recommended but not required. A class definition should use OWL cardinalities (see OWL 2 Quick Reference Guide ) to indicate the properties that instances of the class are allowed to have, and to constrain the number of objects that each property can have. Subclasses of knora-base:Resource are required to have a cardinality for each subproperty of knora-base:hasValue or a knora-base:hasLinkTo that resources of that class can have. Specifically, consistency checking should prevent the following: An object property or datatype property has a subject of the wrong class, or an object property has an object of the wrong class (GraphDB's consistency checke cannot check the types of literals). An object property has an object that does not exist (i.e. the object is an IRI that is not used as the subject of any statements in the repository). This can be treated as if the object is of the wrong type (i.e. it can cause a violation of knora-base:objectClassConstraint , because there is no compatible rdf:type statement for the object). A class has owl:cardinality 1 or owl:minCardinality 1 on an object property or datatype property, and an instance of the class does not have that property. A class has owl:cardinality 1 or owl:maxCardinality 1 on an object property or datatype property, and an instance of the class has more than one object for that property. An instance of knora-base:Resource has an object property pointing to a knora-base:Value or to another Resource , and its class has no cardinality for that property. An instance of knora-base:Value has a subproperty of knora-base:valueHas , and its class has no cardinality for that property. A datatype property has an empty string as an object. Cardinalities in base classes are inherited by derived classes. Derived classes can override inherited cardinalities by making them more restrictive, i.e. by specifying a subproperty of the one specified in the original cardinality. Instances of Resource and Value can be marked as deleted, using the property isDeleted . This must be taken into account as follows: With owl:cardinality 1 or owl:maxCardinality 1 , if the object of the property can be marked as deleted, the property must not have more than one object that has not been marked as deleted. In other words, it's OK if there is more than one object, as long only one of them has knora-base:isDeleted false . With owl:cardinality 1 or owl:minCardinality 1 , the property must have an object, but it's OK if the property's only object is marked as deleted. We allow this because the subject and object may have different owners, and it may not be feasible for them to coordinate their work. The owner of the object should always be able to mark it as deleted. (It could be useful to notify the owner of the subject when this happens, but that is beyond the scope of consistency checking.) Design Ontotext GraphDB provides a mechanism for checking the consistency of data in a repository each time an update transaction is committed. Knora provides GraphDB-specific consistency rules that take advantage of this feature to provide an extra layer of consistency checks, in addition to the checks that are implemented in Knora. When a repository is created in GraphDB, a set of consistency rules can be provided, and GraphDB's consistency checker can be turned on to ensure that each update transaction respects these rules, as described in the section Reasoning of the GraphDB documentation. Like custom inference rules, consistency rules are defined in files with the .pie filename extension, in a GraphDB-specific syntax. We have added rules to the standard RDFS inference rules file builtin_RdfsRules.pie , to create the file KnoraRules.pie . The .ttl configuration file that is used to create the repository must contain these settings: owlim:ruleset \"/path/to/KnoraRules.pie\" ; owlim:check-for-inconsistencies \"true\" ; The path to KnoraRules.pie must be an absolute path. The scripts provided with Knora to create test repositories set this path automatically. Consistency checking in GraphDB relies on reasoning. GraphDB's reasoning is Forward-chaining , which means that reasoning is applied to the contents of each update, before the update transaction is committed, and the inferred statements are added to the repository. A GraphDB rules file can contain two types of rules: inference rules and consistency rules. Before committing an update transaction, GraphDB applies inference rules, then consistency rules. If any of the consistency rules are violated, the transaction is rolled back. An inference rule has this form: Id: <rule_name> <premises> <optional_constraints> ------------------------------- <consequences> <optional_constraints> The premises are a pattern that tries to match statements found in the data. Optional constraints, which are enclosed in square brackets, make it possible to specify the premises more precisely, or to specify a named graph (see examples below). Consequences are the statements that will be inferred if the premises match. A line of hyphens separates premises from consequences. A GraphDB consistency rule has a similar form: Consistency: <rule_name> <premises> <optional_constraints> ------------------------------- <consequences> <optional_constraints> The differences between inference rules and consistency rules are: A consistency rule begins with Consistency instead of Id . In a consistency rule, the consequences are optional. Instead of representing statements to be inferred, they represent statements that must exist if the premises are satisfied. In other words, if the premises are satisfied and the consequences are not found, the rule is violated. If a consistency rule doesn't specify any consequences, and the premises are satisfied, the rule is violated. Rules use variable names for subjects, predicates, and objects, and they can use actual property names. Empty string as object If subject i has a predicate p whose object is an empty string, the constraint is violated: Consistency: empty_string i p \"\" ------------------------------------ Subject and object class constraints If subject i has a predicate p that requires a subject of type t , and i is not a t , the constraint is violated: Consistency: subject_class_constraint p <knora-base:subjectClassConstraint> t i p j ------------------------------------ i <rdf:type> t If subject i has a predicate p that requires an object of type t , and the object of p is not a t , the constraint is violated: Consistency: object_class_constraint p <knora-base:objectClassConstraint> t i p j ------------------------------------ j <rdf:type> t Cardinality constraints A simple implementation of a consistency rule to check owl:maxCardinality 1 , for objects that can be marked as deleted, could look like this: Consistency: max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag i <rdf:type> r r <owl:maxCardinality> \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger r <owl:onProperty> p i p j i p k [Constraint j != k] j <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean k <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ------------------------------------ This means: if resource i is a subclass of an owl:Restriction r with owl:maxCardinality 1 on property p , and the resource has two different objects for that property, neither of which is marked as deleted, the rule is violated. Note that this takes advantage of the fact that Resource and Value have owl:cardinality 1 on isDeleted ( isDeleted must be present even if false), so we do not need to check whether i is actually something that can be marked as deleted. However, this implementation would be much too slow. We therefore use two optimisations suggested by Ontotext: Add custom inference rules to make tables (i.e. named graphs) of pre-calculated information about the cardinalities on properties of subjects, and use those tables to simplify the consistency rules. Use the [Cut] constraint to avoid generating certain redundant compiled rules (see Entailment rules ). For example, to construct a table of subjects belonging to classes that have owl:maxCardinality 1 on some property p , we use the following custom inference rule: Id: maxCardinality_1_table i <rdf:type> r r <owl:maxCardinality> \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger r <owl:onProperty> p ------------------------------------ i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] The constraint [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] means that the inferred triples are added to the context (i.e. the named graph) http://www.ontotext.com/_maxCardinality_1_table . (Note that we have defined the prefix onto as http://www.ontotext.com/ in the Prefices section of the rules file.) As the GraphDB documentation on Rules explains: If the context is provided, the statements produced as rule consequences are not \u2018visible\u2019 during normal query answering. Instead, they can only be used as input to this or other rules and only when the rule premise explicitly uses the given context. Now, to find out whether a subject belongs to a class with that cardinality on a given property, we only need to match one triple. The revised implementation of the rule max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag is as follows: Consistency: max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] i p j [Constraint j != k] i p k [Cut] j <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean k <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ------------------------------------ The constraint [Constraint j != k] means that the premises will be satisfied only if the variables j and k do not refer to the same thing. With these optimisations, the rule is faster by several orders of magnitude. Since properties whose objects can be marked as deleted must be handled differently to properties whose objects cannot be marked as deleted, the knora-base ontology provides a property called objectCannotBeMarkedAsDeleted . All properties in knora-base whose objects cannot take the isDeleted flag (including datatype properties) should be derived from this property. This is how it is used to check owl:maxCardinality 1 for objects that cannot be marked as deleted: Consistency: max_cardinality_1_without_deletion_flag i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] p <rdfs:subPropertyOf> <knora-base:objectCannotBeMarkedAsDeleted> i p j [Constraint j != k] i p k [Cut] ------------------------------------ To check owl:minCardinality 1 , we do not care whether the object can be marked as deleted, so we can use this simple rule: Consistency: min_cardinality_1_any_object i p r [Context <onto:_minCardinality_1_table>] ------------------------------------ i p j This means: if a subject i belongs to a class that has owl:minCardinality 1 on property p , and i has no object for p , the rule is violated. To check owl:cardinality 1 , we need two rules: one that checks whether there are too few objects, and one that checks whether there are too many. To check whether there are too few objects, we don't care whether the objects can be marked as deleted, so the rule is the same as min_cardinality_1_any_object , except for the cardinality: Consistency: cardinality_1_not_less_any_object i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>] ------------------------------------ i p j To check whether there are too many objects, we need to know whether the objects can be marked as deleted or not. In the case where the objects can be marked as deleted, the rule is the same as max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag , except for the cardinality: Consistency: cardinality_1_not_greater_with_deletion_flag i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>] i p j [Constraint j != k] i p k [Cut] j <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean k <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ------------------------------------ In the case where the objects cannot be marked as deleted, the rule is the same as max_cardinality_1_without_deletion_flag , except for the cardinality: Consistency: cardinality_1_not_less_any_object i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>] ------------------------------------ i p j Knora allows a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue or knora-base:hasLinkTo to be a predicate of a resource only if the resource's class has some cardinality for the property. For convenience, knora-base:hasValue and knora-base:hasLinkTo are subproperties of knora-base:resourceProperty , which is used to check this constraint in the following rule: Consistency: resource_prop_cardinality_any i <knora-base:resourceProperty> j ------------------------------------ i p j i <rdf:type> r r <owl:onProperty> p If resource i has a subproperty of knora-base:resourceProperty , and i is not a member of a subclass of an owl:Restriction r with a cardinality on that property (or on one of its base properties), the rule is violated. A similar rule, value_prop_cardinality_any , ensures that if a value has a subproperty of knora-base:valueHas , the value's class has some cardinality for that property.","title":"Consistency Checking"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/consistency-checking/#consistency-checking","text":"","title":"Consistency Checking"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/consistency-checking/#requirements","text":"Knora is designed to prevent inconsistencies in RDF data, as far as is practical, in a triplestore-independent way (see Triplestore Updates ).

This must be taken into account as follows: With owl:cardinality 1 or owl:maxCardinality 1 , if the object of the property can be marked as deleted, the property must not have more than one object that has not been marked as deleted. In other words, it's OK if there is more than one object, as long only one of them has knora-base:isDeleted false . With owl:cardinality 1 or owl:minCardinality 1 , the property must have an object, but it's OK if the property's only object is marked as deleted. We allow this because the subject and object may have different owners, and it may not be feasible for them to coordinate their work. The owner of the object should always be able to mark it as deleted. (It could be useful to notify the owner of the subject when this happens, but that is beyond the scope of consistency checking.)","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/consistency-checking/#design","text":"Ontotext GraphDB provides a mechanism for checking the consistency of data in a repository each time an update transaction is committed. Knora provides GraphDB-specific consistency rules that take advantage of this feature to provide an extra layer of consistency checks, in addition to the checks that are implemented in Knora. When a repository is created in GraphDB, a set of consistency rules can be provided, and GraphDB's consistency checker can be turned on to ensure that each update transaction respects these rules, as described in the section Reasoning of the GraphDB documentation. Like custom inference rules, consistency rules are defined in files with the .pie filename extension, in a GraphDB-specific syntax. We have added rules to the standard RDFS inference rules file builtin_RdfsRules.pie , to create the file KnoraRules.pie . The .ttl configuration file that is used to create the repository must contain these settings: owlim:ruleset \"/path/to/KnoraRules.pie\" ; owlim:check-for-inconsistencies \"true\" ; The path to KnoraRules.pie must be an absolute path. The scripts provided with Knora to create test repositories set this path automatically. Consistency checking in GraphDB relies on reasoning. GraphDB's reasoning is Forward-chaining , which means that reasoning is applied to the contents of each update, before the update transaction is committed, and the inferred statements are added to the repository. A GraphDB rules file can contain two types of rules: inference rules and consistency rules. Before committing an update transaction, GraphDB applies inference rules, then consistency rules. If any of the consistency rules are violated, the transaction is rolled back. An inference rule has this form: Id: <rule_name> <premises> <optional_constraints> ------------------------------- <consequences> <optional_constraints> The premises are a pattern that tries to match statements found in the data. Optional constraints, which are enclosed in square brackets, make it possible to specify the premises more precisely, or to specify a named graph (see examples below). Consequences are the statements that will be inferred if the premises match. A line of hyphens separates premises from consequences. A GraphDB consistency rule has a similar form: Consistency: <rule_name> <premises> <optional_constraints> ------------------------------- <consequences> <optional_constraints> The differences between inference rules and consistency rules are: A consistency rule begins with Consistency instead of Id . In a consistency rule, the consequences are optional. Instead of representing statements to be inferred, they represent statements that must exist if the premises are satisfied. In other words, if the premises are satisfied and the consequences are not found, the rule is violated. If a consistency rule doesn't specify any consequences, and the premises are satisfied, the rule is violated. Rules use variable names for subjects, predicates, and objects, and they can use actual property names.","title":"Design"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/consistency-checking/#empty-string-as-object","text":"If subject i has a predicate p whose object is an empty string, the constraint is violated: Consistency: empty_string i p \"\" ------------------------------------","title":"Empty string as object"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/consistency-checking/#subject-and-object-class-constraints","text":"If subject i has a predicate p that requires a subject of type t , and i is not a t , the constraint is violated: Consistency: subject_class_constraint p <knora-base:subjectClassConstraint> t i p j ------------------------------------ i <rdf:type> t If subject i has a predicate p that requires an object of type t , and the object of p is not a t , the constraint is violated: Consistency: object_class_constraint p <knora-base:objectClassConstraint> t i p j ------------------------------------ j <rdf:type> t","title":"Subject and object class constraints"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/consistency-checking/#cardinality-constraints","text":"A simple implementation of a consistency rule to check owl:maxCardinality 1 , for objects that can be marked as deleted, could look like this: Consistency: max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag i <rdf:type> r r <owl:maxCardinality> \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger r <owl:onProperty> p i p j i p k [Constraint j != k] j <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean k <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ------------------------------------ This means: if resource i is a subclass of an owl:Restriction r with owl:maxCardinality 1 on property p , and the resource has two different objects for that property, neither of which is marked as deleted, the rule is violated. Note that this takes advantage of the fact that Resource and Value have owl:cardinality 1 on isDeleted ( isDeleted must be present even if false), so we do not need to check whether i is actually something that can be marked as deleted. However, this implementation would be much too slow. We therefore use two optimisations suggested by Ontotext: Add custom inference rules to make tables (i.e. named graphs) of pre-calculated information about the cardinalities on properties of subjects, and use those tables to simplify the consistency rules. Use the [Cut] constraint to avoid generating certain redundant compiled rules (see Entailment rules ). For example, to construct a table of subjects belonging to classes that have owl:maxCardinality 1 on some property p , we use the following custom inference rule: Id: maxCardinality_1_table i <rdf:type> r r <owl:maxCardinality> \"1\"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger r <owl:onProperty> p ------------------------------------ i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] The constraint [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] means that the inferred triples are added to the context (i.e. the named graph) http://www.ontotext.com/_maxCardinality_1_table . (Note that we have defined the prefix onto as http://www.ontotext.com/ in the Prefices section of the rules file.) As the GraphDB documentation on Rules explains: If the context is provided, the statements produced as rule consequences are not \u2018visible\u2019 during normal query answering. Instead, they can only be used as input to this or other rules and only when the rule premise explicitly uses the given context. Now, to find out whether a subject belongs to a class with that cardinality on a given property, we only need to match one triple. The revised implementation of the rule max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag is as follows: Consistency: max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] i p j [Constraint j != k] i p k [Cut] j <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean k <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ------------------------------------ The constraint [Constraint j != k] means that the premises will be satisfied only if the variables j and k do not refer to the same thing. With these optimisations, the rule is faster by several orders of magnitude. Since properties whose objects can be marked as deleted must be handled differently to properties whose objects cannot be marked as deleted, the knora-base ontology provides a property called objectCannotBeMarkedAsDeleted . All properties in knora-base whose objects cannot take the isDeleted flag (including datatype properties) should be derived from this property. This is how it is used to check owl:maxCardinality 1 for objects that cannot be marked as deleted: Consistency: max_cardinality_1_without_deletion_flag i p r [Context <onto:_maxCardinality_1_table>] p <rdfs:subPropertyOf> <knora-base:objectCannotBeMarkedAsDeleted> i p j [Constraint j != k] i p k [Cut] ------------------------------------ To check owl:minCardinality 1 , we do not care whether the object can be marked as deleted, so we can use this simple rule: Consistency: min_cardinality_1_any_object i p r [Context <onto:_minCardinality_1_table>] ------------------------------------ i p j This means: if a subject i belongs to a class that has owl:minCardinality 1 on property p , and i has no object for p , the rule is violated. To check owl:cardinality 1 , we need two rules: one that checks whether there are too few objects, and one that checks whether there are too many. To check whether there are too few objects, we don't care whether the objects can be marked as deleted, so the rule is the same as min_cardinality_1_any_object , except for the cardinality: Consistency: cardinality_1_not_less_any_object i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>] ------------------------------------ i p j To check whether there are too many objects, we need to know whether the objects can be marked as deleted or not. In the case where the objects can be marked as deleted, the rule is the same as max_cardinality_1_with_deletion_flag , except for the cardinality: Consistency: cardinality_1_not_greater_with_deletion_flag i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>] i p j [Constraint j != k] i p k [Cut] j <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean k <knora-base:isDeleted> \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ------------------------------------ In the case where the objects cannot be marked as deleted, the rule is the same as max_cardinality_1_without_deletion_flag , except for the cardinality: Consistency: cardinality_1_not_less_any_object i p r [Context <onto:_cardinality_1_table>] ------------------------------------ i p j Knora allows a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue or knora-base:hasLinkTo to be a predicate of a resource only if the resource's class has some cardinality for the property. For convenience, knora-base:hasValue and knora-base:hasLinkTo are subproperties of knora-base:resourceProperty , which is used to check this constraint in the following rule: Consistency: resource_prop_cardinality_any i <knora-base:resourceProperty> j ------------------------------------ i p j i <rdf:type> r r <owl:onProperty> p If resource i has a subproperty of knora-base:resourceProperty , and i is not a member of a subclass of an owl:Restriction r with a cardinality on that property (or on one of its base properties), the rule is violated. A similar rule, value_prop_cardinality_any , ensures that if a value has a subproperty of knora-base:valueHas , the value's class has some cardinality for that property.","title":"Cardinality constraints"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/design-overview/","text":"Knora API Server Design Overview Introduction Knora's responsibilities include: Receiving, validating, authenticating, and authorising HTTP requests from clients (which may be web browsers or other software) to query or update data in a Knora repository. Querying and updating the repository on behalf of clients. Filtering query results according to the user's permissions. Transforming query results into Knora API responses. Ensuring that ontologies and data in the triplestore are consistent and conform to the requirements of the knora-base ontology. Managing the versioning of data in the triplestore. Working with Sipi to store files that cannot be stored as RDF data. Knora is written in Scala , using the Akka framework for message-based concurrency. It is designed to work with any standards-compliant triplestore via the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol , but is currently tested only with Ontotext GraphDB (with support for other triplestores coming soon). Knora APIs Knora supports different versions of its API for working with humanities data: Knora API v2 , a standards-based API currently under development. Knora API v1 , a stable, legacy API that focuses on maintaining compatibility with applications that used Knora's prototype software. There is also a Knora admin API for administering Knora repositories. The Knora code base includes some functionality that is shared by these different APIs, as well as separate packages for each API. Internally, Knora APIs v1 and v2 both use functionality in the admin API. Knora API v1 uses some functionality from API v2, but API v2 does not depend on API v1. Design Diagram Modules HTTP Module org.knora.webapi.routing : Knora's Akka HTTP routes. Each routing class matches URL patterns for requests involving some particular type of data in the repository. Routes are API-specific. For example, ResourcesRouteV2 matches URL paths starting with /v2/resources , which represent requests involving Knora resources. org.knora.webapi.http : a few HTTP-related constants and utilities. Responders Module org.knora.webapi.responders : Each responder is an actor that is responsible for managing some particular type of data in the repository. A responder receives messages from a route, does some work (e.g. querying the triplestore), and returns a reply message. Responders are API-specific and can communicate with other responders via messages. For example, in API v2, ResourcesResponderV2 handles requests involving resources, and delegates some of its tasks to ValuesResponderV2 , which is responsible for requests involving values. Store Module org.knora.webapi.store : Contains actors that connect to triplestores. The most important one is HttpTriplestoreConnector , which communicates with triplestores via the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol . Shared Between Modules org.knora.webapi : Contains core classes such as Main , which starts the Knora server, and SettingsImpl , which represents the application settings that are loaded using the Typesafe Config library. org.knora.webapi.util : Utilities needed by different parts of the application, such as parsing and formatting tools. org.knora.webapi.messages : The Akka messages used by each responder. org.knora.webapi.messages.twirl : Text-generation templates for use with the Twirl template engine . Knora uses Twirl to generate SPARQL requests and other types of text documents. Actor Supervision and Creation At system start, the main application supervisor actor is created in LiveCore.scala : /** * The main application supervisor actor which is at the top of the actor * hierarchy. All other actors are instantiated as child actors. Further, * this actor is responsible for the execution of the startup and shutdown * sequences. */ lazy val appActor: ActorRef = system.actorOf( Props(new ApplicationActor with LiveManagers) .withDispatcher(KnoraDispatchers.KnoraActorDispatcher), name = APPLICATION_MANAGER_ACTOR_NAME ) and through mixin also the store and responder manager actors: /** * The actor that forwards messages to actors that deal with persistent storage. */ lazy val storeManager: ActorRef = context.actorOf( Props(new StoreManager(self) with LiveActorMaker) .withDispatcher(KnoraDispatchers.KnoraActorDispatcher), name = StoreManagerActorName ) /** * The actor that forwards messages to responder actors to handle API requests. */ lazy val responderManager: ActorRef = context.actorOf( Props(new ResponderManager(self) with LiveActorMaker) .withDispatcher(KnoraDispatchers.KnoraActorDispatcher), name = RESPONDER_MANAGER_ACTOR_NAME ) The ApplicationActor is the first actor in the application. All other actors are children of this actor and thus it takes also the role of the supervisor actor. It accepts messages for starting and stopping the Knora-API, holds the current state of the application, and is responsible for coordination of the startup and shutdown sequence. Further, it forwards any messages meant for responders or the store to the respective actor. In most cases, there is only one instance of each supervised actor; such actors do their work asynchronously in futures, so there would be no advantage in using an actor pool. A few actors do have pools of instances, because they do their work synchronously; this allows concurrency to be controlled by setting the size of each pool. These pools are configured in application.conf under akka.actor.deployment . The ApplicationActor also starts the HTTP service as part of the startup sequence: /** * Starts the Knora-API server. * * @param ignoreRepository if `true`, don't read anything from the repository on startup. * @param requiresIIIFService if `true`, ensure that the IIIF service is started. * @param retryCnt how many times was this command tried */ def appStart(ignoreRepository: Boolean, requiresIIIFService: Boolean, retryCnt: Int): Unit = { val bindingFuture: Future[Http.ServerBinding] = Http() .bindAndHandle( Route.handlerFlow(apiRoutes), knoraSettings.internalKnoraApiHost, knoraSettings.internalKnoraApiPort ) bindingFuture onComplete { case Success(_) => // Transition to ready state self ! AppReady() if (knoraSettings.prometheusEndpoint) { // Load Kamon monitoring Kamon.loadModules() } // Kick of startup procedure. self ! InitStartUp(ignoreRepository, requiresIIIFService) case Failure(ex) => if (retryCnt < 5) { logger.error( \"Failed to bind to {}:{}! - {} - retryCnt: {}\", knoraSettings.internalKnoraApiHost, knoraSettings.internalKnoraApiPort, ex.getMessage, retryCnt ) self ! AppStart(ignoreRepository, requiresIIIFService, retryCnt + 1) } else { logger.error( \"Failed to bind to {}:{}! - {}\", knoraSettings.internalKnoraApiHost, knoraSettings.internalKnoraApiPort, ex.getMessage ) self ! AppStop() } } } Coordinated Application Startup To coordinate necessary startup tasks, the application goes through a few states at startup: Stopped: Application starting. Http layer is still not started. StartingUp: Http layer is started. Only '/health' and monitoring routes are working. WaitingForRepository: Repository check is initiated but not yet finished. RepositoryReady: Repository check has finished and repository is available. CreatingCaches: Creating caches is initiated but not yet finished. CachesReady: Caches are created and ready for use. LoadingOntologies: Loading of ontologies is initiated but not yet finished. OntologiesReady: Ontologies are loaded. MaintenanceMode: During backup or other maintenance tasks, so that access to the API is closed Running: Running state. All APIs are open. During the WaitingForRepository state, if the repository is not configured or available, the system will indefinitely retry to access it. This allows for prolonged startup times of the repository. Also, if checking the repository returns an error, e.g., because the repository data needs to be migrated first, the application will shutdown. Concurrency In general, Knora is written in a functional style, avoiding shared mutable state. This makes it easier to reason about concurrency, and eliminates an important potential source of bugs (see Out of the Tar Pit ). The routes and actors in Knora use Akka's ask pattern, rather than the tell pattern, to send messages and receive responses, because this simplifies the code considerably (using tell would require actors to maintain complex mutable state), with no apparent reduction in performance. To manage asynchronous communication between actors, the Knora API server uses Scala's Future monad extensively. See Futures with Akka for details. We use Akka's asynchronous logging interface (see Akka Logging ). What the Responders Do In Knora, a responder is an actor that receives a request message (a Scala case class) in the ask pattern, does some work (e.g. getting data from the triplestore), and returns a reply message (another case class). These reply messages are are defined in org.knora.webapi.messages . A responder can produce a reply representing a complete API response, or part of a response that will be used by another responder. If it's a complete API response, there is an API-specific mechanism for converting it into the response format that the client expects. Store Module (org.knora.webapi.store package) The store module is used for accessing the triplestore and other external storage providers. All access to the Store module goes through the StoreManager supervisor actor. The StoreManager creates pools of actors, such as HttpTriplestoreActor , that interface with the storage providers. The contents of the store package are not used directly by other packages, which interact with the store package only by sending messages to StoreManager . Parsing of SPARQL query results is handled by this module. See Store Module for a more detailed discussion. Triplestore Access SPARQL queries are generated from templates, using the Twirl template engine. For example, if we're querying a resource, the template will contain a placeholder for the resource's IRI. The templates can be found under src/main/twirl/queries/sparql . In many cases, different SPARQL must be generated for different triplestores; the Twirl template function then takes the name of the triplestore as a parameter, and may delegate to triplestore-specific templates. Responders are not expected to know which triplestore is being used or how it is accessed. To perform a SPARQL SELECT query, a responder sends a SparqlSelectRequest message to the storeManager actor, like this: for { isEntityUsedSparql <- Future(queries.sparql.v2.txt.isEntityUsed( triplestore = settings.triplestoreType, entityIri = entityIri, ignoreKnoraConstraints = ignoreKnoraConstraints, ignoreRdfSubjectAndObject = ignoreRdfSubjectAndObject ).toString()) isEntityUsedResponse: SparqlSelectResponse <- (storeManager ? SparqlSelectRequest(isEntityUsedSparql)).mapTo[SparqlSelectResponse] The reply message, SparqlSelectResponse , is a data structure containing the rows that were returned as the query result. To perform a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query, you can use SparqlExtendedConstructRequest , and the response will be a SparqlExtendedConstructResponse . Error Handling The error-handling design has these aims: Simplify the error-handling code in actors as much as possible. Produce error messages that clearly indicate the context in which the error occurred (i.e. what the application was trying to do). Ensure that clients receive an appropriate error message when an error occurs. Ensure that ask requests are properly terminated with an akka.actor.Status.Failure message in the event of an error, without which they will simply time out (see Ask: Send and Receive Future ). When a actor encounters an error that isn't the client's fault (e.g. a triplestore failure), log it, but don't do this with errors caused by bad input. When logging errors, include the full JVM stack trace. The design does not yet include, but could easily accommodate, translations of error messages into different languages. A hierarchy of exception classes is defined in Exceptions.scala , representing different sorts of errors that could occur. The hierarchy has two main branches: RequestRejectedException , an abstract class for errors that are the client's fault. These errors are not logged. InternalServerException , an abstract class for errors that are not the client's fault. These errors are logged. Exception classes in this hierarchy can be defined to include a wrapped cause exception. When an exception is logged, its stack trace will be logged along with the stack trace of its cause . It is therefore recommended that low-level code should catch low-level exceptions, and wrap them in one of our higher-level exceptions, in order to clarify the context in which the error occurred. To simplify error-handling in responders, a utility method called future2Message is provided in ActorUtils . It is intended to be used in an actor's receive method to respond to messages in the ask pattern. If the responder's computation is successful, it is sent to the requesting actor as a response to the ask . If the computation fails, the exception representing the failure is wrapped in a Status.Failure , which is sent as a response to the ask . If the error is a subclass of RequestRejectedException , only the sender is notified of the error; otherwise, the error is also logged and rethrown (so that the KnoraExceptionHandler can handle the exception). In many cases, we transform data from the triplestore into a Map object. To simplify checking for required values in these collections, the class ErrorHandlingMap is provided. You can wrap any Map in an ErrorHandlingMap . You must provide a function that will generate an error message when a required value is missing, and optionally a function that throws a particular exception. Rows of SPARQL query results are already returned in ErrorHandlingMap objects. If you want to add a new exception class, see the comments in Exceptions.scala for instructions. Transformation of Exception to Client Responses The org.knora.webapi.KnoraExceptionHandler is brought implicitly into scope of akka-http , and by doing so registered and used to handle the transformation of all KnoraExceptions into HttpResponses . This handler handles only exceptions thrown inside the route and not the actors. However, the design of reply message passing from actors (by using future2Message ), makes sure that any exceptions thrown inside actors, will reach the route, where they will be handled. See also Fuures with Akka . API Routing The API routes in the routing package are defined using the DSL provided by the akka-http library. A routing function has to do the following: Authenticate the client. Figure out what the client is asking for. Construct an appropriate request message and send it to ResponderManagerV1 , using the ask pattern. Return a result to the client. To simplify the coding of routing functions, they are contained in objects that extend org.knora.webapi.routing.Authenticator . Each routing function performs the following operations: Authenticator.getUserADM is called to authenticate the user. The request parameters are interpreted and validated, and a request message is constructed to send to the responder. If the request is invalid, BadRequestException is thrown. If the request message is requesting an update operation, it must include a UUID generated by UUID.randomUUID , so the responder can obtain a write lock on the resource being updated. The routing function then passes the message to a function in an API-specific routing utility: RouteUtilV1 , RouteUtilV2 , or RouteUtilADM . This utility function sends the message to ResponderManager (which forwards it to the relevant responder), returns a response to the client in the appropriate format, and handles any errors. Logging Logging in Knora is configurable through logback.xml , allowing fine grain configuration of what classes / objects should be logged from which level. The Akka Actors use Akka Logging while logging inside plain Scala Objects and Classes is done through Scala Logging .","title":"Design Overview"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/design-overview/#knora-api-server-design-overview","text":"","title":"Knora API Server Design Overview"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/design-overview/#introduction","text":"Knora's responsibilities include: Receiving, validating, authenticating, and authorising HTTP requests from clients (which may be web browsers or other software) to query or update data in a Knora repository.

Produce error messages that clearly indicate the context in which the error occurred (i.e. what the application was trying to do). Ensure that clients receive an appropriate error message when an error occurs. Ensure that ask requests are properly terminated with an akka.actor.Status.Failure message in the event of an error, without which they will simply time out (see Ask: Send and Receive Future ). When a actor encounters an error that isn't the client's fault (e.g. a triplestore failure), log it, but don't do this with errors caused by bad input. When logging errors, include the full JVM stack trace. The design does not yet include, but could easily accommodate, translations of error messages into different languages. A hierarchy of exception classes is defined in Exceptions.scala , representing different sorts of errors that could occur. The hierarchy has two main branches: RequestRejectedException , an abstract class for errors that are the client's fault. These errors are not logged. InternalServerException , an abstract class for errors that are not the client's fault. These errors are logged. Exception classes in this hierarchy can be defined to include a wrapped cause exception. When an exception is logged, its stack trace will be logged along with the stack trace of its cause . It is therefore recommended that low-level code should catch low-level exceptions, and wrap them in one of our higher-level exceptions, in order to clarify the context in which the error occurred. To simplify error-handling in responders, a utility method called future2Message is provided in ActorUtils . It is intended to be used in an actor's receive method to respond to messages in the ask pattern. If the responder's computation is successful, it is sent to the requesting actor as a response to the ask . If the computation fails, the exception representing the failure is wrapped in a Status.Failure , which is sent as a response to the ask . If the error is a subclass of RequestRejectedException , only the sender is notified of the error; otherwise, the error is also logged and rethrown (so that the KnoraExceptionHandler can handle the exception). In many cases, we transform data from the triplestore into a Map object. To simplify checking for required values in these collections, the class ErrorHandlingMap is provided. You can wrap any Map in an ErrorHandlingMap . You must provide a function that will generate an error message when a required value is missing, and optionally a function that throws a particular exception. Rows of SPARQL query results are already returned in ErrorHandlingMap objects.

To simplify the coding of routing functions, they are contained in objects that extend org.knora.webapi.routing.Authenticator .

The request parameters are interpreted and validated, and a request message is constructed to send to the responder. If the request is invalid, BadRequestException is thrown. If the request message is requesting an update operation, it must include a UUID generated by UUID.randomUUID , so the responder can obtain a write lock on the resource being updated. The routing function then passes the message to a function in an API-specific routing utility: RouteUtilV1 , RouteUtilV2 , or RouteUtilADM .

The idea is simple, a Future is a sort of a placeholder object that you can create for a result that does not yet exist. Generally, the result of the Future is computed concurrently and can be later collected. Composing concurrent tasks in this way tends to result in faster, asynchronous, non-blocking parallel code. The rest of that page is well worth reading to get an overview of how futures work and what you can do with them. In Akka , one of the standard patterns for communication between actors is the ask pattern , in which you send a message to an actor and you expect a reply. When you call the ask function (which can be written as a question mark, ? , which acts as an infix operator), it immediately returns a Future , which will complete when the reply is sent. As the Akka documentation explains in Use with Actors , it is possible to block the calling thread until the future completes, using Await.result . However, they say: 'Blocking is discouraged though as it will cause performance problems.' In particular, by not blocking, you can do several ask requests in parallel. One way to avoid blocking is to register a callback on the future, which will be called when it completes (perhaps by another thread), like this: future.onComplete { case Success(result) => println(result) case Failure(ex) => ex.printStackTrace() } But this won't work if you're writing a method that needs return a value based on the result of a future. In this case, you can register a callback that transforms the result of a future into another future: val newFuture = future.map(x => x + 1) However, registering callbacks explicitly gets cumbersome when you need to work with several futures together. In this case, the most convenient alternative to blocking is to use Future as a monad. The links above explain what this means in detail, but the basic idea is that a special syntax, called a for -comprehension, allows you to write code that uses futures as if they were complete, without blocking. In reality, a for -comprehension is syntactic sugar for calling methods like map , but it's much easier to write and to read. You can do things like this: val fooFuture = (fooActor ? GetFoo(\"foo\")).mapTo[Foo] val barFuture = (barActor ? GetBar(\"bar\")).mapTo[Bar] val totalFuture = for { foo: Foo <- fooFuture bar: Bar <- barFuture total = foo.getCount + bar.getCount } yield total Here the messages to fooActor and barActor are sent and processed in parallel, but you're guaranteed that total won't be calculated until the values it needs are available. Note that if you construct fooFuture and barFuture inside the for comprehension, they won't be run in parallel (see Scala for-comprehension with concurrently running futures ). Handling Errors with Futures The constructors and methods of Future (like those of Try ) catch exceptions, which cause the future to fail. This very useful property of futures means that you usually don't need try - catch blocks when using the Future monad (although it is sometimes helpful to include them, in order to catch low-level exceptions and wrap them in higher-level ones). Any exception thrown in code that's being run asynchronously by Future (including in the yield expression of a for comprehension) will be caught, and the result will be a Future containing a Failure . Also, in the previous example, if fooActor or barActor returns a Status.Failure message, the for -comprehension will also yield a failed future. However, you need to be careful with the first line of the for -comprehension. For example, this code doesn't handle exceptions correctly: private def doFooQuery(iri: IRI): Future[String] = { for { queryResponse <- (storeManager ? SparqlSelectRequest(queries.sparql.v1.txt.getFoo(iri).toString())).mapTo[SparqlSelectResponse] ... } yield ... } The getFoo() method calls a Twirl template function to generate SPARQL. The ? operator returns a Future . However, the template function is not run asynchronously , because it is called before the Future constructor is called. So if the template function throws an exception, it won't be caught here. Instead, you can do this: private def doFooQuery(iri: IRI): Future[String] = { for { queryString <- Future(queries.sparql.v1.txt.getFoo(iri).toString()) queryResponse <- (storeManager ? SparqlSelectRequest(queryString)).mapTo[SparqlSelectResponse] ... } yield ... } Here the Future constructor will call the template function asynchronously, and catch any exceptions it throws. This is only necessary if you need to call the template function at the very beginning of a for -comprehension. In the rest of the for comprehension, you'll already implicitly have a Future object. Using recover on Futures By using recover on a Future , an apt error message can be thrown if the Future fails. This is particularly useful when an an error message should be made more clear depending on the context the Future is used in. For example, we are asking the resources responder to query for a certain resource in order to process it in a special way. However, the client does not know that the resources responder is sent a request and in case the resource cannot be found, the message sent back from the resources responder ( NotFoundException ) would not make sense to it. Instead, we would like to handle the message in a way so that it makes sense for the operation the client actually executed. We can do this by calling recover on a Future . private def mySpecialResourceRequest(iri: IRI, userProfile: UserProfileV1): Future[...] = { val resourceRequestFuture = for { resResponse: ResourceFullResponseV1 <- (responderManager ? ResourceFullGetRequestV1(iri = iri, userProfile = userProfile, getIncoming = false)).mapTo[ResourceFullResponseV1] } yield resResponse val resourceRequestFutureRecovered = resourceRequestFuture.recover { case notFound: NotFoundException => throw BadRequestException(s\"Special resource handling failed because the resource could not be found: ${notFound.message}\") } for { res <- resourceRequestFutureRecovered ... } yield ... } Please note that the content of the Future has to be accessed using <- to make this work correctly. Otherwise the content will never be looked at. Designing with Futures In the current design, Knora almost never blocks to wait for a future to complete. The normal flow of control works like this: Incoming HTTP requests are handled by an actor called KnoraService , which delegates them to routing functions (in the routing package). For each request, a routing function gets an Akka HTTP RequestContext , and calls RouteUtilV1.runJsonRoute (in API v1) or RouteUtilV2.runRdfRouteWithFuture (in API v2) to send a message to a supervisor actor to fulfil the request. This creates a Future that will complete when the relevant responder sends its reply. The routing utility registers a callback on this Future to handle the reply message when it becomes available. The supervisor forwards the message to be handled by the appropriate responder. The responder's receive method receives the message, and calls some private method that produces a reply message inside a Future . This may involve sending messages to other actors using ask , getting futures back, and combining them into a single future containing the reply message. The responder passes that future to ActorUtils.future2Message , which registers a callback on it. When the future completes (perhaps in another thread), the callback sends the reply message. In the meantime, the responder doesn't block, so it can start handling the next request. When the responder's reply becomes available, the routing utility's callback registered in (2) calls complete on the RequestContext , which sends an HTTP response to the client. The basic rule of thumb is this: if you're writing a method in an actor, and anything in the method needs to come from a future (e.g. because you need to use ask to get some information from another actor), have the method return a future. Mixing Futures with non-Futures If you have a match ... case or if expression, and one branch obtains some data in a future, but another branch can produce the data immediately, you can wrap the result of the latter branch in a future, so that both branches have the same type. Here we use an alternative implementation of scala.concurrent.Future , found in akka.http.scaladsl.util.FastFuture , which tries to avoid scheduling to an scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext if possible, i.e. if the given future value is already present: def getTotalOfFooAndBar(howToGetFoo: String): Future[Int] = { for { foo <- howToGetFoo match { case \"askForIt\" => (fooActor ? GetFoo(\"foo\")).mapTo[Foo] case \"createIt\" => FastFuture.successful(new Foo()) } bar <- (barActor ? GetBar(\"bar\")).mapTo[Bar] total = foo.getCount + bar.getCount } yield total } How to Write For-Comprehensions Here are some basic rules for writing for -comprehensions: The first line of a for -comprehension has to be a \"generator\", i.e. it has to use the <- operator. If you want to write an assignment (using = ) as the first line, the workaround is to wrap the right-hand side in a monad (like Future ) and use <- instead. Assignments (using = ) are written without val . You're not allowed to write statements that throw away their return values, so if you want to call something like println that returns Unit , you have to assign its return value to _ . The yield returns an object of the same type as the generators, which all have to produce the same type (e.g. Future ). Execution Contexts Whenever you use a future, there has to be an implicit 'execution context' in scope. Scala's documentation on futures says, 'you can think of execution contexts as thread pools'. If you don't have an execution context in scope, you'll get a compile error asking you to include one, and suggesting that you could use import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global . Don't do this, because the global Scala execution context is not the most efficient option. Instead, use Knora's custom execution context like so: implicit val executionContext: ExecutionContext = system.dispatchers.lookup(KnoraDispatchers.KnoraActorDispatcher)","title":"Futures with Akka"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/futures-with-akka/#futures-with-akka","text":"","title":"Futures with Akka"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/futures-with-akka/#introduction","text":"Scala's documentation on futures introduces them in this way: Futures provide a nice way to reason about performing many operations in parallel \u2013 in an efficient and non-blocking way.

At the moment, only triplestores and IIIF servers (Sipi) are supported. The triplestore support is implemented in the org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore package and the IIIF server support in org.knora.webapi.store.iiif package. Lifecycle At the top level, the store package houses the StoreManager -Actor which is started when Knora starts. The StoreManager then starts the TriplestoreManager and IIIFManager , which each in turn starts their correct actor implementation. HTTP-based Triplestores HTTP-based triplestore support is implemented in the org.knora.webapi.triplestore.http package. An HTTP-based triplestore is one that is accessed remotely over the HTTP protocol. HttpTriplestoreConnector supports the following triplestores: Ontotext GraphDB Fuseki 2 GraphDB Fuseki 2 Embedded Triplestores Embedded triplestores are implemented in the org.knora.webapi.triplestore.embedded package. An embedded triplestore is one that runs in the same JVM as the Knora API server. Apache Jena TDB The support for embedded Jena TDB is currently dropped. The documentation and the code will remain in the repository. You can use it at your own risk. The support for the embedded Jena-TDB triplestore is implemented in org.knora.webapi.triplestore.embedded.JenaTDBActor . The relevant Jena libraries that are used are the following: Jena API - The library used to work programmatically with RDF data Jena TDB - Their implementation of a triple store Concurrency Jena provides concurrency on different levels. On the Jena TDB level there is the Dataset object, representing the triple store. On every access, a transaction (read or write) can be started. On the Jena API level there is a Model object, which is equivalent to an RDF Graph . Here we can lock the model, so that MRSW (Multiple Reader Single Writer) access is allowed. https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/tdb_transactions.html https://jena.apache.org/documentation/notes/concurrency-howto.html Implementation We employ transactions on the Dataset level. This means that every thread that accesses the triplestore, starts a read or write enabled transaction. The transaction mechanism in TDB is based on write-ahead-logging. All changes made inside a write-transaction are written to journals, then propagated to the main database at a suitable moment. This design allows for read-transactions to proceed without locking or other overhead over the base database. Transactional TDB supports one active write transaction, and multiple read transactions at the same time.

Add a new value. Change a value. Delete a value (i.e. mark it as deleted). Delete a resource (i.e. mark it as deleted). Users must be able to edit the same data concurrently. Each update must be atomic and leave the database in a consistent, meaningful state, respecting ontology constraints and permissions. The application must not use any sort of long-lived locks, because they tend to hinder concurrent edits, and it is difficult to ensure that they are released when they are no longer needed. Instead, if a user requests an update based on outdated information (because another user has just changed something, and the first user has not found out yet), the update must be not performed, and the application must notify the user who requested it, suggesting that the user should check the relevant data and try again if necessary. (We may eventually provide functionality to help users merge edits in such a situation. The application can also encourage users to coordinate with one another when they are working on the same data, and may eventually provide functionality to facilitate this coordination.) We can assume that each SPARQL update operation will run in its own database transaction with an isolation level of 'read committed'. This is what GraphDB does when it receives a SPARQL update over HTTP (see GraphDB SE Transactions ). We cannot assume that it is possible to run more than one SPARQL update in a single database transaction. (The SPARQL 1.1 Protocol does not provide a way to do this, and currently it can be done only by embedding the triplestore in the application and using a vendor-specific API, but we cannot require this in Knora.) Permissions To create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an existing value), the user must have permission to modify the containing resource. To create a new version of an existing value, the user needs only to have permission to modify the current version of the value; no permissions on the resource are needed. Since changing a link requires deleting the old link and creating a new one (as described in Linking ), a user wishing to change a link must have modify permission on both the containing resource and the knora-base:LinkValue for the existing link. When a new resource or value is created, it can be given default permissions specified the project's admin data, or (only in API v2) custom permissions can be specified. Ontology Constraints Knora must not allow an update that would violate an ontology constraint. When creating a new value (as opposed to adding a new version of an existing value), Knora must not allow the update if the containing resource's OWL class does not contain a cardinality restriction for the submitted property, or if the new value would violate the cardinality restriction. It must also not allow the update if the type of the submitted value does not match the knora-base:objectClassConstraint of the property, or if the property has no knora-base:objectClassConstraint . In the case of a property that points to a resource, Knora must ensure that the target resource belongs to the OWL class specified in the property's knora-base:objectClassConstraint , or to a subclass of that class. Duplicate and Redundant Values When creating a new value, or changing an existing value, Knora checks whether the submitted value would duplicate an existing value for the same property in the resource. The definition of 'duplicate' depends on the type of value; it does not necessarily mean that the two values are strictly equal. For example, if two text values contain the same Unicode string, they are considered duplicates, even if they have different Standoff markup. If resource R has property P with value V1 , and V1 is a duplicate of V2 , the API server must not add another instance of property P with value V2 . However, if the requesting user does not have permission to see V2 , the duplicate is allowed, because forbidding it would reveal the contents of V2 to the user. When creating a new version of a value, Knora also checks whether the new version is redundant, given the existing value. It is possible for the definition of 'redundant' can depend on the type of value, but in practice, it means that the values are strictly equal: any change, however trivial, is allowed. Versioning Each Knora value (i.e. something belonging to an OWL class derived from knora-base:Value ) is versioned. This means that once created, a value is never modified. Instead, 'changing' a value means creating a new version of the value --- actually a new value --- that points to the previous version using knora-base:previousValue . The versions of a value are a singly-linked list, pointing backwards into the past. When a new version of a value is made, the triple that points from the resource to the old version (using a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue ) is removed, and a triple is added to point from the resource to the new version. Thus the resource always points only to the current version of the value, and the older versions are available only via the current version's knora-base:previousValue predicate. Unlike values, resources (members of OWL classes derived from knora-base:Resource ) are not versioned. The data that is attached to a resource, other than its values, can be modified. Deleting Knora does not actually delete resources or values; it only marks them as deleted. Deleted data is normally hidden. All resources and values must have the predicate knora- base:isDeleted , whose object is a boolean. If a resource or value has been marked as deleted, it has knora-base:isDeleted true and has a knora-base:deleteDate . An optional knora-base:deleteComment may be added to explain why the resource or value has been marked as deleted. Normally, a value is marked as deleted without creating a new version of it. However, link values must be treated as a special case. Before a LinkValue can be marked as deleted, its reference count must be decremented to 0. Therefore, a new version of the LinkValue is made, with a reference count of 0, and it is this new version that is marked as deleted. Since it is necessary to be able to find out when a resource was deleted, it is not possible to undelete a resource. Moreover, to simplify the checking of cardinality constraints, and for consistency with resources, it is not possible to undelete a value, and no new versions of a deleted value can be made. Instead, if desired, a new resource or value can be created by copying data from a deleted resource or value. Linking Links must be treated differently to other types of values. Knora needs to maintain information about the link, including permissions and a version history. Since the link does not have a unique IRI of its own, Knora uses RDF reifications for this purpose. Each link between two resources has exactly one (non-deleted) knora-base:LinkValue . The resource itself has a predicate that points to the LinkValue , using a naming convention in which the word Value is appended to the name of the link predicate to produce the link value predicate. For example, if a resource representing a book has a predicate called hasAuthor that points to another resource, it must also have a predicate called hasAuthorValue that points to the LinkValue in which information about the link is stored. To find a particular LinkValue , one can query it either by using its IRI (if known), or by using its rdf:subject , rdf:predicate , and rdf:object (and excluding link values that are marked as deleted). Like other values, link values are versioned. The link value predicate always points from the resource to the current version of the link value, and previous versions are available only via the current version's knora-base:previousValue predicate. Deleting a link means deleting the triple that links the two resources, and making a new version of the link value, marked with knora-base:isDeleted . A triple then points from the resource to this new, deleted version (using the link value property). The API allows a link to be 'changed' so that it points to a different target resource. This is implemented as follows: the existing triple connecting the two resources is removed, and a new triple is added using the same link property and pointing to the new target resource. A new version of the old link's LinkValue is made, marked with knora-base:isDeleted . A new LinkValue is made for the new link. The new LinkValue has no connection to the old one. When a resource contains knora-base:TextValue with Standoff markup that includes a reference to another resource, this reference is materialised as a direct link between the two resources, to make it easier to query. A special link property, knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo , is used for this purpose. The corresponding link value property, knora-base:hasStandoffLinkToValue , points to a LinkValue . This LinkValue contains a reference count, indicated by knora-base:valueHasRefCount , that represents the number of text values in the containing resource that include one or more Standoff references to the specified target resource. Each time this number changes, a new version of this LinkValue is made. When the reference count reaches zero, the triple with knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo is removed, and a new version of the LinkValue is made and marked with knora-base:isDeleted . If the same resource reference later appears again in a text value, a new triple is added using knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo , and a new LinkValue is made, with no connection to the old one. For consistency, every LinkValue contains a reference count. If the link property is not knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo , the reference count will always be either 1 (if the link exists) or 0 (if it has been deleted, in which case the link value will also be marked with knora-base:isDeleted ). When a LinkValue is created for a standoff resource reference, it is given the same permissions as the text value containing the reference. Design Responsibilities of Responders The resources responder ( ResourcesResponderV1 in API v1, ResourcesResponderV2 in API v2) has sole responsibility for generating SPARQL to create and updating resources, and the values responder ( ValuesResponderV1 or ValuesResponderV2 ) has sole responsibility for generating SPARQL to create and update values. When a new resource is created with its values, the values responder generates SPARQL statements that can be included in the INSERT clause of a SPARQL update to create the values, and the resources responder adds these statements to the SPARQL update that creates the resource. This ensures that the resource and its values are created in a single SPARQL update operation, and hence in a single triplestore transaction. Application-level Locking The 'read committed' isolation level cannot prevent a scenario where two users want to add the same data at the same time. It is possible that both requests would do pre-update checks and simultaneously find that it is OK to add the data, and that both updates would then succeed, inserting redundant data and possibly violating ontology constraints. Therefore, Knora uses short-lived, application-level write locks on resources, to ensure that only one request at a time can update a given resource. Before each update, the application acquires a lock on a resource. To prevent deadlocks, Knora locks only one resource per API operation. It then does the pre-update checks and the update, then releases the lock. The lock implementation (in IriLocker ) requires each API request message to include a random UUID, which is generated in the API Routing package. Using application-level locks allows us to do pre-update checks in their own transactions, and finally to do the SPARQL update in its own transaction. Ensuring Data Consistency Knora enforces consistency constraints using three redundant mechanisms: By doing pre-update checks using SPARQL SELECT queries and cached ontology data. By doing checks in the WHERE clauses of SPARQL updates. By using GraphDB's built-in consistency checker (see Consistency Checking ). We take the view that redundant consistency checks are a good thing. Pre-update checks are SPARQL SELECT queries that are executed while holding an application-level lock on the resource to be updated. These checks should work with any triplestore, and can return helpful, Knora-specific error messages to the client if the request would violate a consistency constraint. However, the SPARQL update itself is our only chance to do pre-update checks in the same transaction that will perform the update. The design of the SPARQL 1.1 Update standard makes it possible to ensure that if certain conditions are not met, the update will not be performed. In our SPARQL update code, each update contains a WHERE clause, possibly a DELETE clause, and an INSERT clause. The WHERE clause is executed first. It performs consistency checks and provides values for variables that are used in the DELETE and/or INSERT clauses. In our updates, if the expectations of the WHERE clause are not met (e.g. because the data to be updated does not exist), the WHERE clause should return no results; as a result, the update will not be performed. Regardless of whether the update changes the contents of the triplestore, it returns nothing. If the update did nothing because the conditions of the WHERE clause were not met, the only way to find out is to do a SELECT afterwards. Moreover, in this case, there is no straightforward way to find out which conditions was not met. This is one reason why Knora does pre-update checks using separate SELECT queries and/or cached ontology data, before performing the update. This makes it possible to return specific error messages to the user to indicate why an update cannot be performed. Moreover, while some checks are easy to do in a SPARQL update, others are difficult, impractical, or impossible. Easy checks include checking whether a resource or value exists or is deleted, and checking that the knora-base:objectClassConstraint of a predicate matches the rdf:type of its intended object. Cardinality checks are not very difficult, but they perform poorly on Jena. Knora does not do permission checks in SPARQL, because its permission-checking algorithm is too complex to be implemented in SPARQL. For this reason, Knora's check for duplicate values cannot be done in SPARQL update code, because it relies on permission checks. In a bulk import operation, which can create a large number of resources in a single SPARQL update, a WHERE clause can become very expensive for the triplestore, in terms of memory as well as execution time. Moreover, RDF4J (and hence GraphDB) uses a recursive algorithm to parse SPARQL queries with WHERE clauses, so the size of a WHERE clause is limited by the stack space available to the Java Virtual Machine. Therefore, in bulk import operations, Knora uses INSERT DATA , which does not involve a WHERE clause. Bulk imports thus rely on checks (1) and (3) above. SPARQL Update Examples The following sample SPARQL update code is simpler than what Knora actually does. It is included here to illustrate the way Knora's SPARQL updates are structured and how concurrent updates are handled. Finding a value IRI in a value's version history We will need this query below. If a value is present in a resource property's version history, the query returns everything known about the value, or nothing otherwise: prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> prefix knora-base: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> SELECT ?p ?o WHERE { BIND(IRI(\"http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a\") as ?resource) BIND(IRI(\"http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula#book_comment\") as ?property) BIND(IRI(\"http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a/values/testComment002\") as ?searchValue) ?resource ?property ?currentValue . ?currentValue knora-base:previousValue* ?searchValue . ?searchValue ?p ?o . } Creating the initial version of a value prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> prefix knora-base: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> WITH <http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula> INSERT { ?newValue rdf:type ?valueType ; knora-base:valueHasString \"\"\"Comment 1\"\"\" ; knora-base:attachedToUser <http://rdfh.ch/users/91e19f1e01> ; knora-base:attachedToProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/77275339> ; knora-base:hasPermissions \"V knora-admin:KnownUser,knora-admin:UnknownUser|M knora-admin:ProjectMember\" ; knora-base:valueTimestamp ?currentTime . ?resource ?property ?newValue . } WHERE { BIND(IRI(\"http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a\") as ?resource) BIND(IRI(\"http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula#book_comment\") as ?property) BIND(IRI(\"http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a/values/testComment001\") AS ?newValue) BIND(IRI(\"http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#TextValue\") AS ?valueType) BIND(NOW() AS ?currentTime) # Do nothing if the resource doesn't exist. ?resource rdf:type ?resourceClass . # Do nothing if the submitted value has the wrong type. ?property knora-base:objectClassConstraint ?valueType . } To find out whether the insert succeeded, the application can use the query in Finding a value IRI in a value's version history to look for the new IRI in the property's version history.

If this is not in fact the most recent version (because someone else has done an update), this operation will do nothing (because the WHERE clause will return no rows). To find out whether the update succeeded, the application will then need to do a SELECT query using the query in Finding a value IRI in a value's version history . In the case of concurrent updates, there are two possibilities: Users A and B are looking at version 1. User A submits an update and it succeeds, creating version 2, which user A verifies using a SELECT. User B then submits an update to version 1 but it fails, because version 1 is no longer the latest version. User B's SELECT will find that user B's new value IRI is absent from the value's version history. Users A and B are looking at version 1. User A submits an update and it succeeds, creating version 2. Before User A has time to do a SELECT, user B reads the new value and updates it again. Both users then do a SELECT, and find that both their new value IRIs are present in the value's version history.

Each update must be atomic and leave the database in a consistent, meaningful state, respecting ontology constraints and permissions. The application must not use any sort of long-lived locks, because they tend to hinder concurrent edits, and it is difficult to ensure that they are released when they are no longer needed. Instead, if a user requests an update based on outdated information (because another user has just changed something, and the first user has not found out yet), the update must be not performed, and the application must notify the user who requested it, suggesting that the user should check the relevant data and try again if necessary. (We may eventually provide functionality to help users merge edits in such a situation. The application can also encourage users to coordinate with one another when they are working on the same data, and may eventually provide functionality to facilitate this coordination.) We can assume that each SPARQL update operation will run in its own database transaction with an isolation level of 'read committed'. This is what GraphDB does when it receives a SPARQL update over HTTP (see GraphDB SE Transactions ). We cannot assume that it is possible to run more than one SPARQL update in a single database transaction. (The SPARQL 1.1 Protocol does not provide a way to do this, and currently it can be done only by embedding the triplestore in the application and using a vendor-specific API, but we cannot require this in Knora.)","title":"General"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#permissions","text":"To create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an existing value), the user must have permission to modify the containing resource. To create a new version of an existing value, the user needs only to have permission to modify the current version of the value; no permissions on the resource are needed. Since changing a link requires deleting the old link and creating a new one (as described in Linking ), a user wishing to change a link must have modify permission on both the containing resource and the knora-base:LinkValue for the existing link. When a new resource or value is created, it can be given default permissions specified the project's admin data, or (only in API v2) custom permissions can be specified.","title":"Permissions"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#ontology-constraints","text":"Knora must not allow an update that would violate an ontology constraint.

It must also not allow the update if the type of the submitted value does not match the knora-base:objectClassConstraint of the property, or if the property has no knora-base:objectClassConstraint . In the case of a property that points to a resource, Knora must ensure that the target resource belongs to the OWL class specified in the property's knora-base:objectClassConstraint , or to a subclass of that class.","title":"Ontology Constraints"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#duplicate-and-redundant-values","text":"When creating a new value, or changing an existing value, Knora checks whether the submitted value would duplicate an existing value for the same property in the resource. The definition of 'duplicate' depends on the type of value; it does not necessarily mean that the two values are strictly equal. For example, if two text values contain the same Unicode string, they are considered duplicates, even if they have different Standoff markup. If resource R has property P with value V1 , and V1 is a duplicate of V2 , the API server must not add another instance of property P with value V2 . However, if the requesting user does not have permission to see V2 , the duplicate is allowed, because forbidding it would reveal the contents of V2 to the user. When creating a new version of a value, Knora also checks whether the new version is redundant, given the existing value. It is possible for the definition of 'redundant' can depend on the type of value, but in practice, it means that the values are strictly equal: any change, however trivial, is allowed.","title":"Duplicate and Redundant Values"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#versioning","text":"Each Knora value (i.e. something belonging to an OWL class derived from knora-base:Value ) is versioned. This means that once created, a value is never modified. Instead, 'changing' a value means creating a new version of the value --- actually a new value --- that points to the previous version using knora-base:previousValue . The versions of a value are a singly-linked list, pointing backwards into the past. When a new version of a value is made, the triple that points from the resource to the old version (using a subproperty of knora-base:hasValue ) is removed, and a triple is added to point from the resource to the new version. Thus the resource always points only to the current version of the value, and the older versions are available only via the current version's knora-base:previousValue predicate. Unlike values, resources (members of OWL classes derived from knora-base:Resource ) are not versioned. The data that is attached to a resource, other than its values, can be modified.","title":"Versioning"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#deleting","text":"Knora does not actually delete resources or values; it only marks them as deleted. Deleted data is normally hidden. All resources and values must have the predicate knora- base:isDeleted , whose object is a boolean. If a resource or value has been marked as deleted, it has knora-base:isDeleted true and has a knora-base:deleteDate . An optional knora-base:deleteComment may be added to explain why the resource or value has been marked as deleted. Normally, a value is marked as deleted without creating a new version of it. However, link values must be treated as a special case. Before a LinkValue can be marked as deleted, its reference count must be decremented to 0. Therefore, a new version of the LinkValue is made, with a reference count of 0, and it is this new version that is marked as deleted. Since it is necessary to be able to find out when a resource was deleted, it is not possible to undelete a resource. Moreover, to simplify the checking of cardinality constraints, and for consistency with resources, it is not possible to undelete a value, and no new versions of a deleted value can be made. Instead, if desired, a new resource or value can be created by copying data from a deleted resource or value.","title":"Deleting"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#linking","text":"Links must be treated differently to other types of values. Knora needs to maintain information about the link, including permissions and a version history. Since the link does not have a unique IRI of its own, Knora uses RDF reifications for this purpose. Each link between two resources has exactly one (non-deleted) knora-base:LinkValue . The resource itself has a predicate that points to the LinkValue , using a naming convention in which the word Value is appended to the name of the link predicate to produce the link value predicate. For example, if a resource representing a book has a predicate called hasAuthor that points to another resource, it must also have a predicate called hasAuthorValue that points to the LinkValue in which information about the link is stored. To find a particular LinkValue , one can query it either by using its IRI (if known), or by using its rdf:subject , rdf:predicate , and rdf:object (and excluding link values that are marked as deleted). Like other values, link values are versioned. The link value predicate always points from the resource to the current version of the link value, and previous versions are available only via the current version's knora-base:previousValue predicate. Deleting a link means deleting the triple that links the two resources, and making a new version of the link value, marked with knora-base:isDeleted . A triple then points from the resource to this new, deleted version (using the link value property). The API allows a link to be 'changed' so that it points to a different target resource. This is implemented as follows: the existing triple connecting the two resources is removed, and a new triple is added using the same link property and pointing to the new target resource. A new version of the old link's LinkValue is made, marked with knora-base:isDeleted . A new LinkValue is made for the new link. The new LinkValue has no connection to the old one. When a resource contains knora-base:TextValue with Standoff markup that includes a reference to another resource, this reference is materialised as a direct link between the two resources, to make it easier to query. A special link property, knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo , is used for this purpose. The corresponding link value property, knora-base:hasStandoffLinkToValue , points to a LinkValue . This LinkValue contains a reference count, indicated by knora-base:valueHasRefCount , that represents the number of text values in the containing resource that include one or more Standoff references to the specified target resource. Each time this number changes, a new version of this LinkValue is made. When the reference count reaches zero, the triple with knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo is removed, and a new version of the LinkValue is made and marked with knora-base:isDeleted . If the same resource reference later appears again in a text value, a new triple is added using knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo , and a new LinkValue is made, with no connection to the old one. For consistency, every LinkValue contains a reference count. If the link property is not knora-base:hasStandoffLinkTo , the reference count will always be either 1 (if the link exists) or 0 (if it has been deleted, in which case the link value will also be marked with knora-base:isDeleted ). When a LinkValue is created for a standoff resource reference, it is given the same permissions as the text value containing the reference.","title":"Linking"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#design","text":"","title":"Design"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#responsibilities-of-responders","text":"The resources responder ( ResourcesResponderV1 in API v1, ResourcesResponderV2 in API v2) has sole responsibility for generating SPARQL to create and updating resources, and the values responder ( ValuesResponderV1 or ValuesResponderV2 ) has sole responsibility for generating SPARQL to create and update values. When a new resource is created with its values, the values responder generates SPARQL statements that can be included in the INSERT clause of a SPARQL update to create the values, and the resources responder adds these statements to the SPARQL update that creates the resource. This ensures that the resource and its values are created in a single SPARQL update operation, and hence in a single triplestore transaction.","title":"Responsibilities of Responders"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#application-level-locking","text":"The 'read committed' isolation level cannot prevent a scenario where two users want to add the same data at the same time. It is possible that both requests would do pre-update checks and simultaneously find that it is OK to add the data, and that both updates would then succeed, inserting redundant data and possibly violating ontology constraints. Therefore, Knora uses short-lived, application-level write locks on resources, to ensure that only one request at a time can update a given resource. Before each update, the application acquires a lock on a resource. To prevent deadlocks, Knora locks only one resource per API operation. It then does the pre-update checks and the update, then releases the lock. The lock implementation (in IriLocker ) requires each API request message to include a random UUID, which is generated in the API Routing package. Using application-level locks allows us to do pre-update checks in their own transactions, and finally to do the SPARQL update in its own transaction.","title":"Application-level Locking"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#ensuring-data-consistency","text":"Knora enforces consistency constraints using three redundant mechanisms: By doing pre-update checks using SPARQL SELECT queries and cached ontology data. By doing checks in the WHERE clauses of SPARQL updates. By using GraphDB's built-in consistency checker (see Consistency Checking ). We take the view that redundant consistency checks are a good thing. Pre-update checks are SPARQL SELECT queries that are executed while holding an application-level lock on the resource to be updated. These checks should work with any triplestore, and can return helpful, Knora-specific error messages to the client if the request would violate a consistency constraint. However, the SPARQL update itself is our only chance to do pre-update checks in the same transaction that will perform the update. The design of the SPARQL 1.1 Update standard makes it possible to ensure that if certain conditions are not met, the update will not be performed. In our SPARQL update code, each update contains a WHERE clause, possibly a DELETE clause, and an INSERT clause. The WHERE clause is executed first. It performs consistency checks and provides values for variables that are used in the DELETE and/or INSERT clauses. In our updates, if the expectations of the WHERE clause are not met (e.g. because the data to be updated does not exist), the WHERE clause should return no results; as a result, the update will not be performed. Regardless of whether the update changes the contents of the triplestore, it returns nothing. If the update did nothing because the conditions of the WHERE clause were not met, the only way to find out is to do a SELECT afterwards. Moreover, in this case, there is no straightforward way to find out which conditions was not met. This is one reason why Knora does pre-update checks using separate SELECT queries and/or cached ontology data, before performing the update. This makes it possible to return specific error messages to the user to indicate why an update cannot be performed. Moreover, while some checks are easy to do in a SPARQL update, others are difficult, impractical, or impossible. Easy checks include checking whether a resource or value exists or is deleted, and checking that the knora-base:objectClassConstraint of a predicate matches the rdf:type of its intended object. Cardinality checks are not very difficult, but they perform poorly on Jena. Knora does not do permission checks in SPARQL, because its permission-checking algorithm is too complex to be implemented in SPARQL. For this reason, Knora's check for duplicate values cannot be done in SPARQL update code, because it relies on permission checks. In a bulk import operation, which can create a large number of resources in a single SPARQL update, a WHERE clause can become very expensive for the triplestore, in terms of memory as well as execution time. Moreover, RDF4J (and hence GraphDB) uses a recursive algorithm to parse SPARQL queries with WHERE clauses, so the size of a WHERE clause is limited by the stack space available to the Java Virtual Machine. Therefore, in bulk import operations, Knora uses INSERT DATA , which does not involve a WHERE clause. Bulk imports thus rely on checks (1) and (3) above.","title":"Ensuring Data Consistency"},{"location":"05-internals/design/principles/triplestore-updates/#sparql-update-examples","text":"The following sample SPARQL update code is simpler than what Knora actually does.

Start the entire knora-stack (fuseki (db), sipi, redis, api, salsah1) with the following command: $ make stack-up Then try opening http://localhost:3333/v1/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2F0803%2Fc5058f3a in a web browser. You should see a response in JSON describing a book. Note : To delete the existing containers and for a clean start, before creating the knora-test repository explained in the first step above, run the following: $ make stack-down-delete-volumes This stops the knora-stack and deletes any created volumes (deletes the database!). To only shut down the Knora-Stack without deleting the containers: $ make stack-down To restart the knora-api use the following command: $ make stack-restart-api If a change is made to knora-api code, only its image needs to be rebuilt. In that case, use $ make stack-up-fast which starts the knora-stack by skipping rebuilding most of the images (only api image is rebuilt). Managing Containers in Docker Dashboard The Docker Desktop is installed on your computer during the installation of docker, it enables easy management of docker containers and access to Docker Hub. To manage your docker containers, docker desktop provides a dashbord. In docker dashboard, you can see all the running containers, stop, start, restart, or completely delete them. For example, when you start the knora-stack as explained above, in the docker dashboard you will see following: Access the logs To read information logged out of any container (db, api, etc.), click on the container in the dashboard and choose logs . The example, below shows the logs of the database (db) container that includes the last SPARQL query sent to the triplestore. Note that, you can also print out the log information directly from the command line. For example, the same logs of the database container can be printed out using the following command: $ make stack-logs-db Similarly, the logs of the other containers can be printed out by running make with stack-logs-api , stack-logs-sipi , or stack-logs-redis . These commands print out and follow the logs, to only print the logs out without following, use -no-follow version of the commands for example: $ make stack-logs-db-no-follow Lastly, to print out the entire logs of the running knora-stack, use $ make stack-logs Running the automated tests To run all test targets, use the following in the command line: $ make test To run only the dsp-api integration tests, use $ make test-it To run only the dsp-api unit tests, use $ make test-unit Lastly, to run all dsp-api test, use $ make test-webapi As explained in the bazel document , to run a single test from the command line, for example SearchV1R2RSpec , run the following: bash $ bazel test //webapi/src/test/scala/org/knora/webapi/e2e/v1:SearchV1R2RSpec Note: to run tests, the api container must be stopped first! Build and Publish Documentation First, you need to install the requirements through: $ make docs-install-requirements Then, to build docs into the local site folder, run the following command: $ make docs-build At this point, you can serve the docs to view them locally using $ make docs-serve Lastly, to build and publish docs to Github Pages, use $ make docs-publish Build and Publish Docker Images To build and publish all Docker images locally $ make docker-build To publish all Docker images to Dockerhub $ make docker-publish Load Testing on Mac OS X To test Knora with many concurrent connections on Mac OS X, you will need to adjust some kernel parameters to allow more open connections, to recycle ephemeral ports more quickly, and to use a wider range of ephemeral port numbers. The script webapi/scripts/macOS-kernel-test-config.sh will do this. Continuous Integration For continuous integration testing, we use Github CI Actions. Every commit pushed to the git repository or every pull request, triggers the build.

Knora is designed to work with any standards-compliant triplestore. It is primarily tested with Ontotext GraphDB , a high-performance, proprietary triplestore. We recommend GraphDB Standard Edition, but GraphDB Free (which is proprietary but available free of charge) also works. Knora includes support for Apache Jena , which is free software , but use of Jena is deprecated, and support for it will probably be removed in the future. Built-in support and configuration for other triplestores is planned. See the chapter on Starting GraphDB for more details. Sipi Build Sipi Docker Image The Sipi docker image needs to be build by hand, as it requires the Kakadu distribution. To build the image, and push it to the docker hub, follow the following steps: $ git clone https://github.com/dhlab-basel/docker-sipi (copy the Kakadu distribution ``v7_8-01382N.zip`` to the ``docker-sipi`` directory) $ docker build -t dhlabbasel/sipi $ docker run --name sipi --rm -it -p 1024:1024 dhlabbasel/sipi (Ctrl-c out of terminal will stop and delete container) $ docker push dhlabbasel/sipi Pushing the image to the docker hub requires prior authentication with $ docker login . The user needs to be registered on hub.docker.com . Also, the user needs to be allowed to push to the dblabbasel organisation. Running Sipi To use the docker image stored locally or on the docker hub repository type: $ docker run --name sipi -d -p 1024:1024 dhlabbasel/sipi This will create and start a docker container with the dhlabbasel/sipi image in the background. The default behaviour is to start Sipi by calling the following command: $ /sipi/local/bin/sipi -config /sipi/config/sipi.knora-test-config.lua To override this default behaviour, start the container by supplying another config file: $ docker run --name sipi \\ -d \\ -p 1024:1024 \\ dhlabbasel/sipi \\ /sipi/local/bin/sipi -config /sipi/config/sipi.config.lua You can also mount a directory (the local directory in this example), and use a config file that is outside of the docker container: $ docker run --name sipi \\ -d \\ -p 1024:1024 \\ -v $PWD:/localdir \\ dhlabbasel/sipi \\ /sipi/local/bin/sipi -config /localdir/sipi.knora-test-config.lua Redis Server The Knora-API server uses Redis for caching.

Make the update process as fast as possible, with some indication of progress as it runs. Design As explained in Knora Ontology Versions , the knora-base ontology contains a version string to ensure compatibility between a repository and a given version of Knora. The same version string is therefore hard-coded in the Knora source code, in the string constant org.knora.webapi.KnoraBaseVersion . For new pull requests, the format of this string is knora-base vN , where N is an integer that is incremented for each version. During Knora's startup process, ApplicationActor sends an UpdateRepositoryRequest message to the StoreManager , which forwards it to TriplestoreManager , which delegates it to org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.RepositoryUpdater . RepositoryUpdater does the following procedure: Check the knora-base version string in the repository. Consult org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.RepositoryUpdatePlan to see which transformations are needed. Download the entire repository from the triplestore into a TriG file. Read the TriG file into an RDF4J Model . Update the Model by running the necessary transformations, and replacing the built-in Knora ontologies with the current ones. Save the Model to a new TriG file. Empty the repository in the triplestore. Upload the transformed repository file to the triplestore. To update the Model , RepositoryUpdater runs a sequence of upgrade plugins, each of which is a class in org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.plugins and is registered in RepositoryUpdatePlan . Design Rationale We tried and rejected several other designs: Running SPARQL updates in the triplestore: too slow, and no way to report progress during the update. Downloading the repository and transforming it in Python using rdflib : too slow. Downloading the repository and transforming it in C++ using Redland : also too slow. The Scala implementation is the fastest by far. The whole repository is uploaded in a single transaction, rather than uploading one named graph at a time, because GraphDB's consistency checker can enforce dependencies between named graphs. Adding an Upgrade Plugin Each time a pull request introduces changes that are not compatible with existing data, the following must happen: The knora-base version number must be incremented in knora-base.ttl and in the string constant org.knora.webapi.KnoraBaseVersion . A plugin must be added in the package org.knora.webapi.store.triplestore.upgrade.plugins , and registered in RepositoryUpdatePlan , to transform existing repositories so that they are compatible with the code changes introduced in the pull request. The order of version numbers must correspond to the order in which the pull requests are merged. An upgrade plugin is a Scala class that extends UpgradePlugin . The name of the plugin class should refer to the pull request that made the transformation necessary, using the format UpgradePluginPRNNNN , where NNNN is the number of the pull request. A plugin's transform method takes an RDF4J Model (a mutable object representing the repository) and modifies it as needed. For details on how to do this, see The RDF Model API in the RDF4J documentation. Before transforming the data, a plugin can check whether a required manual transformation has been carried out. If the requirement is not met, the plugin can throw InconsistentTriplestoreDataException to abort the upgrade process. The plugin must then be appended to the sequence pluginsForVersions in RepositoryUpdatePlan . Testing Update Plugins Each plugin should have a unit test that extends UpgradePluginSpec . A typical test loads a TriG file containing test data into a Model , runs the plugin, makes an RDF4J SailRepository containing the transformed Model , and uses SPARQL to check the result.","title":"Updating Repositories"},{"location":"05-internals/development/updating-repositories/#updating-repositories","text":"","title":"Updating Repositories"},{"location":"05-internals/development/updating-repositories/#requirements","text":"When a new version of Knora requires an existing repository to be updated, do this automatically when Knora starts, if possible.

Please see sipi.knora-docker-config.lua for the settings like URL, port number etc. These settings need to be set accordingly in Knora's application.conf . If you use the default settings both in Sipi and Knora, there is no need to change these settings. Whenever a file is requested from Sipi (e.g. a browser trying to dereference an image link served by Knora), a preflight function is called. This function is defined in sipi.init-knora.lua present in the Sipi root directory. It takes three parameters: prefix , identifier (the name of the requested file), and cookie . The prefix is the shortcode of the project that the resource containing the file value belongs to. Given this information, Sipi asks Knora about the current's users permissions on the given file. The cookie contains the current user's Knora session id, so Knora can match Sipi's request with a given user profile and determine the permissions this user has on the file. If the Knora response grants sufficient permissions, the file is served in the requested quality. If the suer has preview rights, Sipi serves a reduced quality or integrates a watermark. If the user has no permissions, Sipi refuses to serve the file. However, all of this behaviour is defined in the preflight function in Sipi and not controlled by Knora. Knora only provides the permission code. See Authentication of Users with Sipi for more information about sharing the session ID.

Whereas Knora deals with data that is written to and read from a triplestore (metadata and annotations), Sipi takes care of storing, converting and serving image files as well as other types of files such as audio, video, or documents (binary files it just stores and serves). Knora and Sipi stick to a clear division of responsibility regarding files: Knora knows about the names of files that are attached to resources as well as some metadata and is capable of creating the URLs for the client to request them from Sipi, but the whole handling of files (storing, naming, organization of the internal directory structure, format conversions, and serving) is taken care of by Sipi. Adding Files to Knora A file is first uploaded to Sipi, then its metadata is submitted to Knora. The implementation of this procedure is described in Knora and Sipi . Instructions for the client are given in Creating File Values (for Knora API v2) and in Adding Resources with Image Files (for API v1). Retrieving Files from Sipi File URLs in API v2 In Knora API v2, image file URLs are provided in IIIF format. In the simple ontology schema , a file value is simply a IIIF URL that can be used to retrieve the file from Sipi. In the complex schema, it is a StillImageFileValue with additional properties that the client can use to construct different IIIF URLs, e.g. at different resolutions. See the knora-api ontology for details. File URLs in API v1 In API v1, for each file value, Knora creates several Sipi URLs for accessing the file at different resolutions: \"resinfo\": { \"locations\": [ { \"duration\": \u200b0, \"nx\": \u200b95, \"path\": \"http://sipiserver:port/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jpg/full/max/0/default.jpg\", \"ny\": \u200b128, \"fps\": \u200b0, \"format_name\": \"JPEG\", \"origname\": \"ad+s167_druck1=0001.tif\", \"protocol\": \"file\" }, { \"duration\": \u200b0, \"nx\": \u200b82, \"path\": \"http://sipiserver:port/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jp2/full/82,110/0/default.jpg\", \"ny\": \u200b110, \"fps\": \u200b0, \"format_name\": \"JPEG2000\", \"origname\": \"ad+s167_druck1=0001.tif\", \"protocol\": \"file\" }, { \"duration\": \u200b0, \"nx\": \u200b163, \"path\": \"http://sipiserver:port/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jp2/full/163,219/0/default.jpg\", \"ny\": \u200b219, \"fps\": \u200b0, \"format_name\": \"JPEG2000\", \"origname\": \"ad+s167_druck1=0001.tif\", \"protocol\": \"file\" } ... ], \"restype_label\": \"Seite\", \"resclass_has_location\": true, Each of these paths has to be handled by the browser by making a call to Sipi, obtaining the binary representation in the desired quality.

See Data Formats in Knora . Does Knora store XML files? XML files do not lend themselves to searching and linking. Knora's RDF storage is better suited to its goal of facilitating data reuse. If your XML files represent text with markup (e.g. TEI/XML ), the recommended approach is to allow Knora to store it as Standoff/RDF . This will allow both text and markup to be searched using Gravsearch . Knora can also regenerate, at any time, an XML document that is equivalent to the original one. If you have XML that simply represents structured data (rather than text documents), we recommend converting it to Knora resources, which are stored as RDF. Triplestores Which triplestores can be used with Knora? Knora is tested with Ontotext GraphDB SE . Our goal is to support several triplestores, including open-source options. Integration with Apache Jena Fuseki has been partly implemented, but is not currently supported. Knora Ontologies Can a project use classes or properties defined in another project's ontology? Knora does not allow this to be done with project-specific ontologies. Each project must be free to change its own ontologies, but this is not possible if they have been used in ontologies or data created by other projects. However, an ontology can be defined as shared, meaning that it can be used by multiple projects, and that its creators promise not to change it in ways that could affect other ontologies or data that are based on it. See Shared Ontologies for details. There will be a standardisation process for shared ontologies (issue #523 ). Why doesn't Knora use rdfs:domain and rdfs:range for consistency checking? Knora's consistency checking uses Knora-specific properties, which are called knora-base:subjectClassConstraint and knora-base:objectClassConstraint in the knora-base ontology, and knora-api:subjectType and knora-api:objectType in the knora-api ontologies. These properties express restrictions on the possible subjects and objects of a property. If a property's subject or object does not conform to the specified restrictions, Knora considers it an error. In contrast, the RDF Schema specification says that rdfs:domain and rdfs:range can be used to \"infer additional information\" about the subjects and objects of properties, rather than to enforce restrictions. This is, in fact, what RDFS reasoners do in practice. For example, consider these statements: example:hasAuthor rdfs:range example:Person . data:book1 example:hasAuthor data:oxygen . To an RDFS reasoner, the first statement means: if something is used as the object of example:hasAuthor , we can infer that it's an example:Person . The second statement is a mistake; oxygen is not a person. But an RDFS reasoner would infer that data:oxygen is actually an example:Person , since it is used as the object of example:hasAuthor . Queries looking for persons would then get data:oxygen in their results, which would be incorrect. Therefore, rdfs:domain and rdfs:range are not suitable for consistency checking. Knora therefore uses its own properties, along with OWL cardinalities, which it interprets according to a \"closed world\" assumption. Knora performs its own consistency checks to enforce these restrictions. Knora repositories can also take advantage of triplestore-specific consistency checking mechanisms. The constraint language SHACL may someday provide a standard, triplestore-independent way to implement consistency checks, if the obstacles to its adoption can be overcome (see Diverging views of SHACL ). For further discussion of these issues, see SHACL and OWL Compared . Can a user-created property be an owl:TransitiveProperty ? No, because in Knora, a resource controls its properties. This basic assumption is what allows Knora to enforce permissions and transaction integrity. The concept of a transitive property would break this assumption. Consider a link property hasLinkToFoo that is defined as an owl:TransitiveProperty , and is used to link resource Foo1 to resource Foo2 : Suppose that Foo1 and Foo2 are owned by different users, and that the owner of Foo2 does not have permission to change Foo1 . Now suppose that the owner of Foo2 adds a link from Foo2 to Foo3 , using the transitive property: Since the property is transitive, a link from Foo1 to Foo3 is now inferred. But this should not be allowed, because the owner of Foo2 does not have permission to add a link to Foo1 . Moreover, even if the owner of Foo2 did have that permission, the inferred link would not have a knora-base:LinkValue (a reification), which every Knora link must have. The LinkValue is what stores metadata about the creator of the link, its creation date, its permissions, and so on (see LinkValue ). Finally, if an update to one resource could modify another resource, this would violate Knora's model of transaction integrity, in which each transaction can modify only one resource (see Application-level Locking ). Knora would then be unable to ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Should 0.0.0.0 or localhost be used to access Knora locally When running locally with the default configuration, if you want authorization cookies to be shared between webapi and sipi , then both webapi and sipi must be accessed over 0.0.0.0 , or otherwise, the cookie will not be sent to sipi .
